                "reviewBody": "Possibly the most influential of all slasher films, John Carpenter&apos;s Halloween is the reason why this particular subgenre of horror even exists in the first place. Although it wasn&apos;t the first of its kind, it certainly was the game-changer for almost every other slasher flick that followed this low-budget indie horror only ended up imitating the formula that this classic originated.\n\nSet in Haddonfield, Illinois, the story of Halloween begins on the titular night in 1963 where we witness the 6-years old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death with a kitchen knife. The plot then jumps 15 years in the span of which Myers remained silent in a mental hospital he was confined to, only to escape from the facility and returns to his hometown to kill some more.\n\nCo-written &amp; directed by John Carpenter, whose innate ability to churn out quality pictures from mere scraps of filmmaking elements has earned him a place amongst world cinema&apos;s most influential filmmakers, Halloween is one of the finest works of his career that presents the director in complete control of his craft, and the way he sets the pace &amp; eerie tone from the beginning is a delight to watch.\n\nCarpenter creates an uncanny mood during the title sequence only which has nothing but a jack-o-lantern on the black screen, accompanied by the now iconic score, and follows it up with an expertly shot prologue which instantly brings the audience into the story. The script is equally impressive for the character of Michael Myers is handled with extreme care, and the writers leave no stone unturned to show him as an unstoppable force of evil.\n\nThe technical aspects are skilfully executed, and every dollar of its low budget is efficiently used in service of the story. Setting the plot in a suburban location turns the very openness of the area into a playground of mayhem. Cinematography is inventive for the camera stalks our characters at all times, benefits from some ingenious placements, and is further uplifted by clever lighting while Editing makes sure that the suspenseful ambiance is kept alive from start to finish.\n\nBut the biggest contributor, in my opinion, is John Carpenter&apos;s minimal, synthesised score for it elevates the tension to a whole different level and greatly amplifies the desired effect of its disquieting camera-work &amp; editing. Whenever its main theme surfaces on the screen, there&apos;s an uneasiness felt in those moments &amp; whispers of an ominous presence dominate those sequences. It&apos;s one of Carpenter&apos;s most notable musical pieces &amp; is a major reason behind this film&apos;s success.\n\nComing to the acting department, Halloween features a budget-friendly cast in Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, P.J. Soles, Nancy Loomis &amp; Nick Castle. The film marks Curtis&apos; acting debut and she does a neat job as Laurie; a high-school student who&apos;s continuously stalked by Myers throughout the movie. Pleasence is in as Myers&apos; psychiatrist and the only person who knows what this homicidal maniac is capable of. And Soles &amp; Loomis do a fine job as Laurie&apos;s friends who are also pursued by Myers.\n\nBut it&apos;s the character of Michael Myers and how he&apos;s portrayed in this film that establishes him as one of the greatest antagonists in cinema history. Using nothing but a cheap mask that conveys no emotions, keeping him mute throughout the story &amp; giving him an almost mythic strength that renders him invincible, Carpenter presents Myers as a devil incarnate who kills without empathy, and intelligently uses his presence in the film to build a sinister aura, not to mention the very aspects of this character has gone on to inspire many more villains.\n\nOn an overall scale, Halloween remains one of the genre-defining films of the 1970s whose narrative structure has been adopted as a blueprint for slasher films ever since and its vast influence on cinema &amp; pop culture cannot be downplayed. There were a couple of moments that bothered me but for the most part, this is a thrilling, entertaining &amp; satisfying ride from Carpenter that is every bit worthy of its legendary status. A lesson in horror filmmaking that downplays the elements of gore &amp; graphic violence to show the lasting effect a consistently maintained tense ambiance can have on the viewers, Halloween is the very definition of a slasher film."

                "reviewBody": "Chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. This movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. One of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. The setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. The quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in Jack Torrance&apos;s mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil&apos;s new playground. I always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. This film is a perfect example of this very thought.\n\nAnd it is within this film&apos;s subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy&apos;s big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind&apos;s fine line between sane and insane, Kubrick&apos;s purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. I have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, I am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that I have ever seen. I thought that the runtime of the film could&apos;ve been cut by a little bit, but then again, I am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe I should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. All in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man&apos;s mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.\n\nRating: 9/10",

And although our hapless heroine is the primary target of abuse (from her mother, her peers, and &apos;authority&apos;) abuse is also meted out liberally to others---violence against women (Travolta/Allen), and public humiliation by authority figures (Buckley/her gym class) also add to the discomfort level  (the John Travolta-Nancy Allen relationship is defined solely by abuse---and they in turn are the initiators of Carrie&apos;s humiliation).\n\nExcept for Betty Buckley&apos;s gym teacher, all the characters are cartoonish archetypes---and almost all of these achetypes are brilliantly drawn. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly have been singled out for praise, but DePalma even managed to get the right performance out of decidedly untalented performers like Nancy Allen, William Katt (who is immeasurably aided by the kind of meticulous lighting that would have made Joan Crawford envious), and P.J. Soles.\n\nBuckley deserves special mention, because she does amazing things with a completely underwritten role.  By humanizing what could have been just one more cartoon (the lesbian gym teacher---lesbianism is never mentioned, but Buckley&apos;s subtle performance affirms what she has acknowledged in interviews--that she played her character as a lesbian) she provides a central point of reality that keeps the film from spinning completely out of control.\n\nDePalma&apos;s intent was clearly not to scare the audience, but to make the audience watch the film from a distance, deliberately plagarizing two of the most notable sequences in film history---Hitchcock&apos;s shower sequence and Eisenstein&apos;s use of the three-perspective split screen.  The shower scene takes place early in the film, cuing the audience into the fact that this is a film ABOUT film.  And in the climactic prom sequence, DePalma distances himself, and the audience, from the bloodbath on the screen by reminding us through the &apos;theft&apos; from Eisenstein that its just a movie at the most critical moment.\n\nThere are two significant flaws in the film.  For some reason, DePalma interjected a &apos;fast forward&apos; comedy sequence involving the purchase of tuxedos--the sequence serves no purpose in the film, other than to restate the obvious fact that this is &apos;just a movie&apos;.\n\nThe second flaw is Amy Irving&apos;s performance.  Its not horrible by any means, but it just doesn&apos;t work.  Irving has grown as an actress since then (she was the only decent thing about the execrable sequel to Carrie) but the demands made of her in Carrie were beyond her skills at the time it was made.  &apos;Chris&apos; was supposed to be the conscience of the film, but winds up as wishy-washy.\n\nOh, and DON&apos;T watch this film on commercial television--rent the video. DePalma engages in some sacriligeous imagery that is ALWAYS cut from the film when it is shown on television---imagery that justifies the penultimate sequence of the film itself, and brings closure to it."

                "reviewBody": "Jaws is very much a spiritual child of Moby Dick, with a Great White Shark inserted in place of a giant white whale.\n\nThe hunting of the shark means something different for each of the three main male leads. For Brody, killing the shark would mean ensuring the safety of his children (the relationship between parents and their children being a strong running theme in nearly all of Spielberg&apos;s films). For Hooper, the shark is just another shark. It&apos;s his job to study them and provide his expertise. That&apos;s it. Then there&apos;s Quint, a Captain Ahab like figure whose obsession places him in a fit of blind fury. To him, all sharks are the same and killing this one would operate as ultimate revenge.\n\nAnd like Moby Dick, Jaws is a perfectly told straightforward story depicting believable human beings and observing human behavior. Part of the joy of Jaws is watching these characters interact with each other in ways that make them seem truly alive and real, which only serves to make the threat of the shark even more threatening. We also have the land scenes of the first half that expose the stakes at the same time as it depicts the conflict between Brody and the mayor who wants to keep the beach open.\n\nAnd of course, the film is marvelously constructed by Spielberg. Much is made of the way he directs the scenes of suspense, but there&apos;s also very intelligent decisions being made in non-action scenes. Many shots burned into my eyes are something as simple as a quiet moment between a father and his son who is innocently ignorant of the danger at hand.",

And it&apos;s called genius.\n\nNever have I seen a film matched in shock, terror, writing, or performances. This isn&apos;t a horror movie.  The film itself is both a moving and terrifying drama that takes a realistic look at what would actually happen if a young girl were possessed in modern America.  William Peter Blatty&apos;s script is amazing, bringing depth to the characters, and presenting the mystery of faith that they all deal with.  Is Regan possessed?  Is she insane?  And most importantly, Is there a God?  In the course of two hours, we see a sweet and innocent young girl become a cross masturbating, head spinning, murderous, creature.  We see a successful actress overcome skepticism to save her daughter, and we see a brilliant psychiatrist struggle with his devotion to God as a priest.\n\nFriedkin&apos;s direction is marvelous, with wonderful uses of light, dark, and color throughout the film.  Jason Miller (as Damien Karras) is beautifully subtle in his first film acting role.  Max Von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb provide engaging supporting performances as the experienced priest who senses his impending doom, and a detective who senses something sinister is at work. Ellen Burstyn gives a brutally honest performance as a grief stricken woman trying to save her daughter.  And most of all, a 12-year-old Linda Blair gives one of the most terrifying, convincing, and beautiful performances ever shown on film.  Her range of emotion and connection to Regan are astonishing.  She deserved that Oscar!\n\nTHE EXORCIST presents to us the mystery of faith in it&apos;s most raw form--the battle of good and evil.  It is an incomparable masterpiece of film, done without the aid of computers and special effects.  It relies on story and performances to give us a marvelous and terrifying piece of work.  In the end, it makes us ask ourselves what we believe, and keeps us wondering and shuddering at exactally what might be out there.",

                "reviewBody": "Sometimes to judge a film fairly you really need to consider the time at which it was made and what film-making technology existed at that time. This was the first big budget film to really tackle the subject of paranormal investigation, and at the time it was made it was seamless and sleek. It would be easy for people today to put it down for some of the early 1980&apos;s effects, but let&apos;s flip this perspective around and consider that no CGI what-so-ever was used. But at the same time, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; has a strangely family-friendly vibe. It was directed by Tobe Hooper, but it has the unmistakable fingerprints of producer/writer Steven Spielberg all over it. It focuses on an ordinary, harmless suburban family living their usual lives (their biggest problem is the death of a pet bird), which is suddenly thrown into chaos by outside forces. And unlike most horror movies, there isn&apos;t even a lot of violence... well, except for one grotesque hallucination.\n\nDon&apos;t expect the usual gore and typical shocks you see in all modern horror films these days, Poltergeist is not about that. With all of the elements of visual effects, sound, acting, directing (Tobe Hooper) and writers (Steven Spielberg) this is one film that achieves everything you want to see in a motion picture. Anyway, Jo Beth Williams and Craig T. Nelson are great in this film. They have real chemistry. You believe they love each other and are a team. The kids are pretty great, too. It&apos;s actually quite a thoughtful movie and even has an odd warmth to it. Though there are a few scary moments. The final fifteen minutes are played out to such effect, that one could call it pure horror.\n\nOverall rating: 7 out of 10.",

                "reviewBody": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre can, and will, be reinterpreted by critics and theorists for decades to come. It was shot in the summer of 1973, during the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Munich Olympics massacre, at the height of the Watergate scandal and the legal investigation into the shootings at Kent State. It was an era of plane hijackings, government oppression and dishonesty, racial conflict, terrorism and revolution. As a mirror of a dark period in American history, Chain Saw remains one of the best evocations yet of the era, as a group of young individuals, returning to the nostalgic home of their childhood, stumble into the raw and irrational cruelty of the modern world.\n\nThe movie has a weak, though functional storyline, one that has since became the staple for slasher movies; a group of teenagers get lost, stumble across evil and get stalked and killed. But Chain Saw isn&apos;t about storyline and plot; it&apos;s about creating an experience, a sensory overload. The cast and crew work tirelessly to create scenes and images that are raw and powerful and ultimately, against all expectations, beautiful. Leatherface&apos;s travesty of motherly domesticity as he prepares dinner, his child-like dance in the dawn light, the open door at the gas station, the van making it&apos;s slow turn off the road towards the derelict and ivy clad Hardesty residence are all images that burn themselves into your consciousness after just a single viewing.\n\nThe cinematography is exceptional. Watching the Special Edition, you&apos;d never know that this was shot on 16mm in poor light. The picture quality is outstanding, the colors rich and vibrant, the blacks inky and menacing. The brilliant azure skies, the jade green of the grass, the bright red generator, the searing sunlight and stifling shadows. Every frame seems saturated in nicotine gold. Beautiful.\n\nThough not always likable, the actors are always believable. Performances are universally startling, but special mention has to go to Marilyn Burns. Though she has little more to work with than the clich\u00e9d screaming heroine, she works it with remarkable conviction. It was a traumatic shoot, and it shows. Few actresses have so effectively conveyed mind-numbing terror.\n\nThe soundtrack is exceptional and deserves more recognition. It is a great testimony to the experimentation and risk taking attitude of the era that all melody is destroyed under an industrial ambient soundscape of metallic clangs, scrapes and screams, evoking the atmosphere of the local slaughterhouse and the Family&apos;s state of mind. Terrifying.\n\nDespite the complete lack of gore or extreme physical violence, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre continues to horrify and holds up the countless, shot-on-video, slasher clones of subsequent years for the puerile crap that they truly are. Whether by accident or design, this one is a classic.\n\n9 out of 10",

                "reviewBody": "Alien remains one of the most original, terrifying movies of all time. Compare this with the lame sci fi horrors we get nowadays, 1979, and it still packs a huge punch.\n\nFantastically atmospheric, chilling and terrifying even now, the story holds up incredibly well. The special effects were incredible for the time, no wonder the franchise is still in demand, though sadly nowhere near the quality of this one or its amazing successor.\n\nThe music is fantastic, the direction is incredible, and as for the Alien itself, way ahead of its time. Weaver is phenomenal, but arguably she&apos;s upstaged by the creature.\n\nYou can&apos;t help but remember scenes days after watching it, it definitely has the chill factor.\n\nA cinematic masterpiece. 10/10",

                "reviewBody": "Robert De Niro is one of those actors that just melts into a role.  His performance as rapist, convict, and all-around not-a-very-nice fellow Max Cady is certainly one of his most memorable performances for its stamina, strength, and excessiveness.  The film by Martin Scorsece is a remake of the classic film starring Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck.  Although Scorsece keeps the spirit of the film intact, he does make some very modern changes. He changes the role of Sam Bowden and family from one of harmony to dysfunction.  No character is the epitome of a universal good, but rather flawed(very flawed) goodness.  Nick Nolte does a fine job as Bowden and Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis both give deep, emotional performances. The film is really a sea of emotion...most of that emotion being fear. Scorsece adds some arty touches with the camera, but it is his gritty style that really dominates the film&apos;s impact.  Scorsece also is ever the protector of film as he gives cameos to Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Martin Balsam(all in the original film).  The other acting standout goes to Joe Don Baker as a hired private investigator.  But make no mistake....this is De Niro&apos;s film all the way.  He has some of the best lines as he harasses the Bowden family, terrorizes the Bowden family, and strips the Bowden family of all civility, pretense, and dignity.  This film is definitely a keeper!"

Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins&apos; Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.\n\nAnthony Perkins&apos; skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).\n\nPerkin&apos;s fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein&apos;s classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",

                "reviewBody": "Without a doubt, the work of Cunningham and Carpenter during 1978 &amp; 1980 rocked the world of the horror genre. Friday the 13th is one of the films that to this day still has repercussions. It demonstrated the importance of setting the tone in horror movies, making the audience themselves feel as if they too were being stalked. Cunningham also was one of the few directors to introduce the idea of a possible female serial killer.\n\nWithout this film, Scream&apos;s Randy would have never uttered those famous words, &apos;There are certain rules to surviving a horror movie..&apos; This film combined with Carpenter&apos;s Halloween, firmly etched the rules in stone. The creepy music, the infamous &quot;ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha&quot;, the crude photography and the graphic depiction of the murders of the counsellors all blend together to give a classic piece of film history. It scared the hell out of multitudes of teenagers who, in many instances could see themselves in the victims of the stalker. These weren&apos;t bad people getting killed, these were just your typical average American kids, having a good time, getting picked off.\n\nThat is what makes this film so defining, that is why, for all its crude and harsh imagery, this is a classic. This is why alot of recent attempts at horror don&apos;t measure up. It&apos;s not the effects or the blood necessarily, it&apos;s the atmosphere and the familiarity that bring it home.It is more frightening to think, &quot;That could be me&quot;"

It is a true contemporary classic that effortlessly combines action, horror, suspense, and science fiction elements to deliver an exhilarating and unforgettable cinematic experience.\n\nFrom the beginning, the movie grabs your attention with its intense and atmospheric setting in the dense jungles of Central America. The plot revolves around a group of highly skilled soldiers, played by a talented ensemble cast including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura, who find themselves being hunted down by an extraterrestrial creature known as the Predator. The tension and excitement build up as the soldiers try to outwit and survive this deadly adversary.\n\nOne of the movie&apos;s greatest strengths lies in its ability to create a palpable sense of fear and suspense. The anticipation and the unknown nature of the Predator generate an air of uncertainty that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The masterful direction by John McTiernan, coupled with the excellent cinematography and gripping musical score, adds to the overall intensity and contributes to the movie&apos;s success.\n\nThe visual effects of Predator are nothing short of remarkable. The Predator itself, with its iconic design and thermal vision, has become an instantly recognizable symbol in science fiction and horror. The practical effects make the action sequences thrilling and believable and it was all done without CGI.\n\nBeyond the action and suspense, Predator also offers thought-provoking themes and interesting character dynamics. The movie explores the nature of warfare, masculinity, and the human survival instinct. It delves into the psychological toll of combat and the lengths individuals will go to protect their comrades. This added layer of depth elevates Predator above your typical action movie, making it a memorable and enduring piece of cinema.\n\nAs for the performances, Arnold Schwarzenegger shines as the tough and tenacious leader, bringing his indomitable presence and charisma to the screen. The chemistry among the cast members is evident, creating a sense of camaraderie essential to the movie&apos;s success.\n\nIn conclusion, Predator is a timeless action masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences even after decades since its release. Its thrilling storyline, intense action sequences, groundbreaking visual effects, and compelling themes make it a must-watch for any fan of the genre. Whether you&apos;re a long-time fan or new to the movie, Predator is an exhilarating journey that should not be missed."

                "reviewBody": "That&apos;s what most of the other commentators say, and I can&apos;t disagree.  Part 1 (or the first half, depending on which format you&apos;re seeing it in) is great:  pitting some excellent child actors (including future star Seth Green of Buffy the Vampire Slayer) portraying some in-depth characters fighting against a demonic clown.  The second half seems more like a &quot;gee-wow - look who we got&quot; self-indulgence at casting Anderson, Thomas, Reid and Ritter, with very little to make us care about these folks.  The ending is also an incredible dumbed-down letdown, although in all fairness I don&apos;t think they could pull off King&apos;s ending, and most of the audience wouldn&apos;t understand it if they had tried.  There are a few touching moments in the last half, and Tim Curry couldn&apos;t screw up no matter how bad the writing is, but generally the two mismatched halves make for a mediocre film when it could have been so much more.",

After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors&apos; edition and have watched it many times since.\n\nThe film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter&apos;s direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he &quot;feels&quot; like a real person, rather than a hollywood &quot;all american hero&quot;.  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.",

                "reviewBody": "It is very rare nowadays in Hollywood that $112,000 will cover anything more than the cost of catering on most movies. And yet that was all it took for George Romero and a number of friends of his in Pittsburgh to make what is without a doubt one of the most significant horror films of all times, the 1968 shocker NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. Detested by a lot of critics in its day for several scenes of unsettling gruesomeness (though Herschell Gordon Lewis&apos; gore films earlier in the 1960s beat him to the punch for true stomach-turning horror), the film is now understandably highly prized of its relentless, logical approach, and for being so utterly uncompromising.\n\nNot much more needs to be said about the plot: it merely involves seven people who have barricaded themselves inside a rural Pennsylvania home after having been attacked by flesh-eating ghouls who have returned to life from the dead as the result of an exploded Venus probe bringing back a dangerous and unknown form of radiation. What Romero and his co-scenarist John Russo (who took partial inspiration for this film from Richard Matheson&apos;s classic 1954 end-of-the-world vampire novel &quot;I Am Legend&quot;) show, however, is the strain built up by the way the characters, especially the ones portrayed by Duane Jones and the film&apos;s co-producer Karl Hardman, react to the horror that engulfs them...whether to stay on the ground floor, or to hide in the cellar, and how best to escape even as more and more of the undead surround the place. As it turns out, of course, there is no real way out, and there is no actual good end to the whole horrible situation.\n\nRomero, who would continue his travail through the world of the undead through several sequels over the ensuing four decades, shot this film in black-and-white largely on location just outside of Pittsburgh over several weekends in the second half of 1967. NIGHT has, in many ways, the feel of a 1950s &quot;invasion&quot; film (think INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS), but its setting of an isolated house under siege clearly has its roots in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s 1963 classic THE BIRDS; and the scenes of the ghouls munching on human flesh, though brief in nature, were then, and in many ways still are, shockingly contemporary. The cast of primarily amateur actors does well at being totally naturalistic, and the low budget look of the film gives it a documentary feel that hadn&apos;t been seen in horror films before, but which would be revisited in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.\n\nEven after four decades of parody, imitation, and sequels, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is still not for those with weak constitutions, and for those who have seen far more graphic shockers, it will likely seem painfully old-fashioned. But for true horror connoisseurs, it is up there with the very best, and is an essential film of its kind and its era.",

                "reviewBody": "Gremlins was a fantastic comedy film from 1984-the best year ever in my opinion for great movies.\n\nBasically, a guy called Billy Peltzer picks up a new pet called Gizmo and after breaking a few rules he shouldn&apos;t have, ends up spawning a bunch of ugly creatures called Gremlins who proceed to terrorize the town.\n\nThe film is a success because it succeeds at producing both a comedy and a horror in one go which can&apos;t be easy. Most comedy horror films are a joke (such as some of the Ghoulies films which emulated the Gremlins series) but Gremlins is both funny and scary. It&apos;s funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it&apos;s also scary throughout-they&apos;re not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well.\n\nGremlins deserves a look from anyone interested in seeing a good comedy horror movie."

Since the 1981 release, Bruce Campbell has found work on many film projects due to his break out performance in the Evil Dead. Raimi, has gone on to direct many films. Both have earned much of their career based on this little horror movie, that has been re-produced / recycled by thousands of &quot;wanna-be&quot; film makers world wide. This is not your typical &quot;zombie&quot; film, let alone your garden variety horror movie as well. The Evil Dead is one of those black comedies / horror movies that overwhelms the audience to either be scared out of their wits or won over by the movie&apos;s story and over the top characters. The Evil Dead is what most, if not all horror movies should be, very real and powerful.",

                "reviewBody": "What makes this film so wonderful to watch is not simply the acting, or the terror it instills, or even the plot itself.  It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.\n\nHaley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character&apos;s soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.\n\nBruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.\n\nThe Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they&apos;ll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way."

                "reviewBody": "Every small-town neighborhood has an old legend that never dies. For the residents of Elm Street, Fred Krueger is the demonic soul that plagues their nightmares. Krueger was an evil child molester, burned alive by the parents of the children he had slain in the past. Now, years later, he has reappeared in the nightmares of Elm Street&apos;s teenagers. Nancy (Heather Langenkamp) continually experiences these haunting visions in which the permanently scarred man chases her through the shadows of a boiler room -- the same room in which he used to slay his helpless victims. Nancy considers her dreams to be typical nightmares one of her best friends is apparently &quot;sliced&quot; to death during a deep sleep in her home.\n\nSoon Nancy&apos;s dreams become worse, and her boyfriend Glen (Johnny Depp) admits that he has also been experiencing unpleasant nightmares. Together they uncover the truth behind Krueger&apos;s death years ago, and vow to stay awake as long as they can and strategize a plan to bring Krueger back into the &quot;real world&quot; and kill him once and for all.\n\nLoosely based on true events, Wes Craven&apos;s inspiration for the tale originated after he reportedly read that a number of people across the world had died in their slumber. Blending fantasy with reality, Craven wrote and directed one of the most iconic horror films of all time, which -- similar to &quot;Halloween&quot; before it -- spawned an inferior legion of sequels and imitators, all of which continue to pale in comparison to the original.\n\nThe brilliance of &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is that it relies on psychological fear vs. cheap exploitation tricks. &quot;Halloween,&quot; directed by John Carpenter and released in 1978, had re-sparked interest in the Hitchcock-style horror/thrillers, and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; builds upon this, cleverly channeling the mystery surrounding dreams and using it as a gateway for chills and thrills. Midway through the movie, a doctor played by Richard Fleischer tells Nancy&apos;s mother that the process of dreams -- where do they come from? -- has yet to be explained, and the fact that all humans tend to have dreams on a regular basis is essentially why this film remains so scary, even by today&apos;s standards. Some of the special effects are quite outdated but, unlike the &quot;Nightmare&quot; imitators, gore plays second to the plot and characters -- something rare in a horror film.\n\nThe sequels became sillier and gorier. Fred&apos;s name changed to the less menacing &quot;Freddy&quot; (which we all now know him by), he was given more screen time, the makeup on his face was not quite as horrific, he began to crack jokes more often and his voice evolved into a less demonic cackle. In the original &quot;Nightmare&quot; it is interesting to note that Freddy is rarely given screen time at all -- we see his infamous hands (wearing gloves with butter knives attached on the fingers to slice his victims), we see his hat, we see his sweater, we see his outline in the darkness of the shadows, but even when we finally see Freddy up-close, Craven manages to keep the camera moving so that we never gain a distinct image of the killer. Now, twenty years later, there&apos;s no mystery anymore -- Freddy&apos;s face is featured on the front cover for most of the films and his very presence has become the cornerstone of all the movies in the franchise. But in 1984, long before Craven predicted his character would become a huge part of modern pop culture, Freddy was mysterious and not very funny at all.\n\nThe acting is one of the film&apos;s weaknesses -- Heather Langenkamp is never totally awe-inspiring as Nancy, truth be told (although she does a decent job); Depp -- in his big-screen debut -- shows a sign of talent to come but basically mutters clich\u00e9d dialogue most of the time. The co-stars are acceptable at best. However the greatest performance is -- not surprisingly -- by Robert Englund, as Freddy, who is in the film barely at all. Ironically, as mentioned above, this only makes the film succeed at scaring us.\n\nThe direction is not as superb as &quot;Halloween,&quot; and for that matter either is the film. Over the years, &quot;Nightmare&quot; has arguably been given an overrated reputation, although it is inferior to &quot;Halloween.&quot; However, compared to some of the other so-called &quot;horror films&quot; released during the &apos;80s -- including &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and other dumb slasher flicks -- &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; does seem to stand as one of the best horror films of the decade. Despite its flaws it is quite smart with a surprise &quot;final&quot; ending and one of cinema&apos;s greatest villains lurking at the core.\n\n&quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is really Nancy&apos;s story. The film focuses on Nancy&apos;s troubles, Nancy&apos;s dreams and Nancy&apos;s actions. The ending of the film becomes a bit muddled -- the booby traps are unfortunately a bit goofy and Freddy helplessly (almost humorously) chasing Nancy around her home supposedly trying to murder her is something the film could have done without -- but overall it is a satisfying mixture of horror, thriller and fantasy, a movie that taps into two seldom-recognized everyday events in human life, which are sleeping, and dreaming. Craven&apos;s ability to realize this unknown fear in a movie is, needless to say, quite fascinating. &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; is not a great movie but for horror buffs it is a must-see and for non-horror-buffs there is a fair amount of other elements to sustain one&apos;s interest."

                "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve been listening to a podcast about Alfred Hitchcock in the past few weeks, so I decided to take a look and see which of his films I could watch with minimal fuss. &quot;The Birds&quot; was, of all things, on regular non streaming television (I know!) last week, so I set the recorder and watched it for the first time in a while. I have to say that, despite a couple of flaws, I really rather enjoyed it.\n\nMelanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) heads to a small coastal town on the west coast of America, to connect with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). The pairs awkward courtship is interrupted by moments of unusual and violent behaviour from the bird population of the town. The scale of the violence increases with each incident, causing the Daniels and Brenner to barricade themselves in Brenner&apos;s farmhouse.\n\nInterestingly, watching it today what &quot;The Birds&quot; feels most like, particularly once you get to the farmhouse assault is a zombie film, with a mostly unseen force banging on the doors and desperate fortifications that have been hastily assembled. It does take quite a while to get to the bird attacks, but I did enjoy the slightly salacious romantic comedy drama that the film is, prior to the shift into becoming a horror film. Hedren and Taylor are a delightful pair, but there&apos;s intrigue afoot with his former girlfriend now the schoolteacher in town and his mother seemingly unhappy about any potential romance.\n\nAdmittedly, the composite work on mixing bird footage in with the filmed pieces hasn&apos;t aged well and, though I don&apos;t need my films to each be tied up in a nice bow, the ending remains one of the most &quot;. . . Wait, what?. . .&quot; moments in all of film. To describe it as anticlimactical doesn&apos;t do the term justice.\n\nI still enjoyed it though and, with certain caveats, would recommend it.",

                "reviewBody": "This 2017 production of Stephen King&apos;s book is a well-crafted, decently acted imagining of the story. I really enjoyed it but did speak to some people who were disappointed that it had diverged from the book too much.\n\nIn brief, the children of Derry are going missing at an alarming rate. Something evil lurks in the town and it&apos;s up to the Loser&apos;s Club to overcome their fear and unite to confront IT ...\n\nI found the old TV movie somewhat dull in the second half. The first half, which this movie is concerned with, was always the stronger half and I think this version is probably just as good, if not better than the original TV movie. It&apos;s certainly more gruesome and scary.\n\nI&apos;m not sure Tim Curry&apos;s Pennywise has been upstaged though. Bill Skarsgard has done a good job but I think Curry&apos;s is hard to beat.\n\nIT 2017 is refreshingly old-school, in that it focuses on character and story, unlike too many recent &quot;horror&quot; movies. It is beautifully shot and superbly acted but perhaps could move at a slightly better pace.\n\nIT will divide opinions due to story vs screenplay issues but it&apos;s definitely not a bad remake.",

                "reviewBody": "At the end of Evil Dead 2 Ash is sucked back in time through a time warp. He returns to medieval times where he is mistaken for the prophesied saviour.  He is sent to recover the lost Necronomicon to save the people but also return him to his own time.  Typically he makes a mistake when reading the book and he reserectes the army of the undead onto the land.  Ash must fight to defeat yet more undead fiends!\n\nThe third in the series sees the gore drop off and the comedy step up even more.  The previous two were both darkly funny but this is just plain hilarious.  The sheer raft of one liners and silly/horror set ups keeps you laughing all the way.  The horror is not scary as before \u0096 mainly because the gore is gone, however I prefer this as the stop motion stuff gives it an old fashioned feel that adds to the value of it \u0096 it&apos;s hard to explain but I really enjoy this because it feels like an old Harryhausen film.\n\nCampbell is brilliant \u0096 I bet he can&apos;t believe hi s luck, the rest of his career he&apos;s struggled but Rami seem to love him.  And rightly so, he is like Jim Carrey but has so much more talent and is a classic B-movie leading man type.  The rest of the cast are so-so but really this is an one man show and he does it really well.\n\nOverall this is a great little film.  Fans of the series will love it, fans of comedy should love it and fans of B-movie cheese should enjoy it.  And the less gore means fun for all the family (almost)."

                "reviewBody": "Rightfully tense and spooky thriller from director Richard Donner that grabs its audience and does not let go until the shocking finale. American Ambassador Gregory Peck has come up with an idea after his new-born son dies at birth: he decides to pass another child off to wife Lee Remick as their own. Life in England seems grand for a few years, but as the child becomes a toddler (in the form of the young Harvey Stephens) strange murders start to occur. The child is really the son of Satan, born of a goat, and his only goal is to grow up and take over the world for his unearthly father. As the truth slowly unfolds, the film twists into disturbing murders and highly unholy situations. Not a film for the faint of heart and certainly not a perfect film, but still one of the stronger films of the usually luke-warm genre. 4 stars out of 5."

                "reviewBody": "Since &quot;Nattevagten&quot; I have not seen a thriller that has kept me on the edge of my seat as well as &quot;Saw&quot;. Right from the beginning this original story sucks you in and doesn&apos;t let you go until the very end. Thrillers as gripping as this one have become extremely rare in times like these, where people have seen almost everything and can guess any twist during the first half of the movie. With &quot;Saw&quot; James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the creative heads behind this project, set new standards. Think you&apos;re hard-boiled? Think again and watch &quot;Saw&quot;, a movie that will creep you out and surprise you beyond your expectations.\n\n&quot;Saw&quot; has been advertised as the new &quot;Se7en&quot; and while both movies are definitely in the same tradition, &quot;Saw&quot; does a much better job at actually being creepy. Jigsaw is the most gruesome killer the cinema has seen in a loooong time. Wan and Whannel really came up with a monster that has no peer. Where many movies drift into ridiculousness trying to establish the villain as an almost superhuman evil being, &quot;Saw&quot; does never get anywhere near that trap. Sure, the cops are depicted way too stupid and the killer is unrealistically smart, outshining each and every opponent with his perfect plans, but hey, &quot;Se7en&quot; and &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot; didn&apos;t care too much about realism, either, did they?\n\n&quot;Saw&quot; does have some flaws. Those sped-up tracking shots have just been used too many times by now, the structure of the script is weird and jumps from one period of time to another, some characters&apos; lines are a bit clich\u00e9d. However, considering that this movie was made in only 18 days by two independent filmmakers with literally no budget at all, it&apos;s really inappropriate to be petty about technical subtleties, when Wan and Whannel came up with such an original and stirring movie.\n\nI can&apos;t remember the last time I&apos;ve been surprised by a movie&apos;s final twist, but &quot;Saw&quot; has an ending that I didn&apos;t see coming at all. This thriller is the most original piece of independent film-making since &quot;Cube&quot;. I&apos;m really looking forward to seeing how Wan and Whannell&apos;s career develops after this fine sleeper.",

                "reviewBody": "&quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; is one of the best horror films ever made.  This isn&apos;t because it&apos;s going to scare the pants off you with a series of sensational jolts.  This isn&apos;t the shallow, gimmicky kind of horror movie we mostly get these days, and it isn&apos;t the traditional old-fashioned horror film of an earlier era.  This is a movie that came out during a period of transition in Hollywood.  The old production codes were breaking down and films could suddenly be more true to life in the way they showed how people really lived, acted and talked.  1968s &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; is a more sophisticated, less elegant thriller of the kind that Alfred Hitchcock patented, but it displays much more class and intelligence than the horror movies that would come out in its wake.  Popular &apos;70s films such as &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and &quot;The Omen&quot; are the prodigy of &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby,&quot; but offer far less nuance and much greater vulgarity.  What we get here is a more naturalistic depiction of modern life, but without the crassness that would soon explode into American cinema.  \n\nMost of the credit for what makes &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby&quot; such a successful film goes to Roman Polanski.  Polanski is a master at conveying to an audience not just a sense of the uncanny but a vivid depiction of it.  His earlier films like &quot;Knife in the Water,&quot; &quot;Repulsion&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Vampires,&quot; display the talents that would come to such a controlled mastery in &quot;Rosemary&apos;s Baby.&quot;\n\nPolanski very faithfully adapts Ira Levin&apos;s novel to the screen so that the viewer is, just as the reader was, free to interpret the eerie events of the story as either reality or a depiction of an isolated woman&apos;s decent into madness.  At the same time the picture can be taken as a black joke on the human male&apos;s fears of the changes a woman goes through during pregnancy, both physically and emotionally.  But Polanski seems most interested in presenting a normal world, in this case Manhattan in the mid 1960s, and then through subtle cinematic techniques get an audience to actually believe that the hysterical, fantastic ravings of the heroine could be true.  It is this tour de force exercise in suspension of disbelief that makes the film a classic.  The horror films that have come since have had to ratchet up the shock effects in order to thrill more desensitized audiences, but this deliberately paced film reminds us of how much better it is to leave things to the imagination of the viewer.  That is where films really come alive and remain so.\n\nThe Paramount DVD presents an excellent print of the movie that looks as if it were shot yesterday, along with extras that include new interviews with Polanski, executive producer Bob Evans and production designer Richard Sylbert, and a featurette from the time of the film&apos;s original release that really works as a good time capsule.",

                "name": "A good film tainted by a senseless onscreen tragedy",
                "reviewBody": "It is very hard to think of another film anywhere that had such a great potential as TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE had, only to have a senseless and totally preventable tragedy--the deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two illegally hired Asian child actors--mar the impact.  Aside from that, and some heavy-handed moralizing that even the original show&apos;s creator Rod Serling would have had problems with, this is a fairly good tribute to what was perhaps the best TV series in history.\n\nThe prologue (with Dan Aykroyd and Albert Brooks) and Segment 1 are both originals, written and directed by John Landis.  The segment deals with a very embittered white man (Morrow) who, after being dealt the denial of a promotion at work in favor of a Jew, unleashes his bigotry at a bar.  But when he steps outside, he soon gets a dose of his own bitter medicine: persecution by the Nazis in Vichy France circa 1943; stalked by the KKK in Alabama in 1956; attacked by US soldiers in Vietnam circa 1969.  Landis&apos; penchant for hamfisted dialogue and erratic direction dilute what could have been an effective piece; and the tragedy that occurred on his watch taints not only this segment but much of the rest of the movie.\n\nSegment 2, a remake of the 1961 episode &quot;Kick The Can&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, stars Scatman Crothers as an elderly magician who brings a sense of youth to the residents of a senior citizens home, though over the objections of a veritable old fuddy-duddy (Bill Quinn).  Spielberg has often been attacked, mostly unnecessarily, for his tendency toward sloppy sentimentality, but here a lot of the attacks may be justified, despite the best of intentions.  He is still my favorite director, but this is one of his weakest.\n\nSegment 3 remakes &quot;It&apos;s A Good Life.&quot;  Under the inventive hands of director Joe Dante (THE HOWLING), this film stars Jeremy Licht as a boy with the power to enslave and terrorize his family when he comes to feel that they hate him.  Kathleen Quinlan stars as the teacher who unintentionally gets caught up in the melee, only to wind up volunteering to teach Licht how to better use his powers before they become too big for him to control (a la CARRIE).  Dante&apos;s use of inventive special effects (courtesy of Rob Bottin) and black comedy enliven this segment, despite some weird overacting from the rest of the segment&apos;s cast (including William Schallert and Kevin McCarthy).\n\nSegment 4 is a reworking of the famous episode &quot;Nightmare At 20,000 Feet.&quot; With George Miller (MAD MAX) at the director&apos;s helm, the segment stars John Lithgow as an incredibly anxious passenger with a morbid fear of flight who constantly sees a monstrous gremlin tearing apart at the wings of his plane during a severe storm.  His anxiety explodes into terror and madness, and the other passengers think he is certifiable.  But when the plane lands, and the damage is inspected...\n\nThe final score on this is that Landis and Spielberg, who also produced, come up with the weaker segments, and Dante and, especially, Miller come up with the best ones.  Miller&apos;s segment is a truly kinetic piece of suspense and terror, though I did find the little girl (Christina Nigra) an extremely obnoxious and unnecessary presence.  Lithgow, who takes over for William Shatner (who had the role in the TV episode), gives a bravura performance, arguably paving the way for his role in &quot;2010&quot; as an astronaut deftly afraid of heights.\n\nJerry Goldsmith&apos;s usual efficient score and some good special effects work help to make TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE not only an above-average tribute to a great TV show, but also a good anthology film that combines fantasy, suspense, and mystery.  It is a shame that the film is tainted by a pointless tragedy.  But if one can ignore that, there are rewards to be had by seeing this.",

                "reviewBody": "Misery has to be the best adaptation of a Stephen King novel.  A close runner up is Stand By Me, but for suspense and tension that just gets tighter and tighter, watch Misery.  Kathy Bates can go from nice and cheerful to downright crazy like someone turning on a light switch.  While watching James Caan suffer through the torture that Bates puts him through, you can&apos;t help but sympathize with the guy.  Rob Reiner presents us with the problem, and he slowly escalates the tension and the dread that creeps over the movie.  Even though the book was different in the &quot;hobbling&quot; process, Annie Wilkes&apos; method of hobbling still gives me the chills whenever I watch it."

                "reviewBody": "sometimes you have to catch a film on a big screen, while it is still in movie theaters. &quot;The Mist&quot; is clearly in that category. I will be thinking about this scary, moving, smart, and original work for days. I would like to say nice job for the screenplay, and direction, to Frank Durabant. He obviously understands the genre, and how to keep an audience engaged for a few hours, in the dark. There really is not much more to say about &quot;The Mist.&quot; The cast, lead by Thomas Jane and Marcia Gay Harden, is brilliant. Some of the camera shots are amazing. The look of the supernatural creatures is stunning. The sound design in this film is creepy, and beautiful. The production design, art direction, is great. Every aspect of film making comes together here.\n\nTo summarize the story-in a small town in Main, VI, a man/David Drayton/and his son, join a big group of people hiding from supernatural creatures in a supermarket. These bug like creatures are brought to the town by a mist, which envelopes the town, and everyone there. I would describe &quot;The Mist&quot; as a cross between &quot;8 Legged Freaks,&quot; and &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot; It is original, scary, dark, serious, smart, and moving.\n\nI have one large problem, though. The ending, which I will not discuss in detail with my comments, is in my opinion to realistic. We go to the movies to escape reality, not to visit reality. However, please do not wait for this film to appear at the DVD store. You might miss out on the chance to get real close to your date, when you get scared and you want him or her to protect you.\n\nIn closing, I will be brief. Do not miss this film. Go. I am real happy I had the chance to see &quot;The Mist&quot; in a theater. My hope is that you all get that chance as well."

                "reviewBody": "Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero&apos;s masterpiece - one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time. It is 1978 classic this movie really started the zombie genre. It is been almost 40 years anniversary now since this movie come out. Night of the Living Dead was George A. Romero&apos;s first film that really introduced the zombie genre, but this to me really started the zombie praise. This in my opinion is one of the best zombie movies of all time. \n\nIt is my number 1 favorite zombie movie I love this movie to death and it is one of my personal favorite horror films of all time. This movie is based on a Zombie apocalypse this group find&apos;s them self&apos;s with this pilot who takes them with the helicopter in the air and they find a shopping mall. There is a perfect place to go in to a &quot;Zombie Apocalypse.&quot; So they go in to shopping mall and they have every single item in that shopping mall after disposal to use on the zombies. \n\nAs you can tell it is a very fun movie but more important this movie inspires zombies. Without this movie there wouldn&apos;t have been The Walking Dead there wouldn&apos;t be 28 Days Later there wouldn&apos;t have been any of that. This movie is very important this days it was remade in 2004. It is a fun, fun ride I enjoy this film it is entertaining horror flick. Back in the 1978 that come out it was more scary than it is today. This is where I give this movie the most credit, just like... you have a great time watching people murdering zombies. This movie has a great action, great story, plot, great effects the real zombies. It has gore, blood, you se heads been blowing off. George A. Romero&apos;s wrote and direct brilliantly this movie. Tom Savini creates a great special effects for the zombies. Great make up, great blood squibs. The film is fast paced it is excellent brilliant. You see all those SWAT team sieging the building shooting the zombies and gunning the down violent gang. You see whole world comes to an end and people shooting zombies even kids are zombies in this movie. \n\nThe group in the shopping mall has to deal not only with zombies and the disposing them, they also have to deal with poachers who break in to their home and start stealing items and letting zombies in the mall. Tom Savini was one of the motorcycle poachers who was stealing items in the mall. Gaylen Ross was a fantastic babe as Francine news reporter. David Emge as Stephen the pilot was excellent. Ken Foree as Peter a SWAT team member was the best in this movie. Scott H. Reiniger as Roger another SWAT team member was good in his role. They don&apos;t make movies like this today anymore. It&apos;s a R-rated movie and it is a perfect 10. Dawn of the Dead is one of the best zombie apocalyptic movies of all time, I highly recommend this film to any horror fan.",

                "reviewBody": "It was always the films where a child is in peril that stuck with me the most. Child&apos;s Play was probably the top of the crop.\n\nThe film taps into all those things you remember as a child like those colorful commercials that would promote the cereal you were eating. And those big dolls like &apos;My Buddy&apos;, that even as a kid I knew were creepy.\n\nScript, acting, music, mood, atmosphere, direction, scares, everything works and that&apos;s why I give it the high rating it deserves.\n\nBrad Dourif was the perfect choice for the voice of the Chucky doll. It&apos;s sinister and angry and darkly sarcastic. He is what I consider to be one of the all time great underrated actors.\n\nThe film is bleak. There&apos;s nothing happy about it although the good guy doll commercials insist it&apos;s playtime.\n\nAfter this film, the only sequel I highly recommend is Child&apos;s Play 2, which I love just about as much as this one. Part 3 wasn&apos;t bad. Bride of Chucky was an interesting new direction to go in, but the feeling of the first couple of films is long gone by then, and Seed of Chucky was about the same."

                "reviewBody": "This movie is a true eye opener.  I remember seeing it with a few friends and we all had the same reaction to it.  Especially in the scene where the guy is used in an experimental manner by the aliens.  We were all scared and appalled.  Could you imagine?  We all wondered and winced at the mere thought of being used as an experiment, how awful and painful and traumatic an experience that would be.  But take a closer look and when your eyes are opened, what you may see is like looking into a blurred reflection in a mirror.  And the question has to be asked.  What would we do if the same situation occurred here on Earth.  What if we found an alien stranded here, or better yet what if we kidnapped one?  Would we let it live a normal peaceful life?  Or would we put it under the knife and do DNA testing, take blood samples, urine samples, semen samples?  Would we do every possible experiment to this creature as we possibly could?  You&apos;re damn right we would!  And perhaps that wasn&apos;t the films intention ( to draw parallels to us and them ) but then again maybe it was.  The problem though is that we only see what we want to see.  But really, what separates us from them?  Our humanity?  HA!  What is humanity?  It is being human, and sometimes that can be more disgusting than being alien.  We don&apos;t know their intentions or motivations, but we do know ours and that makes us inhumane for doing some of what we do.  \n\nFire In The Sky is a frightening movie.  It is a frightening thought that this could happen to us, and it is disturbing to think that this may have happened to some people already.  I had clouded thoughts and opinions about aliens before seeing this film.  But after the movie I was compelled to do my own research about apparent alien abductions and such.  And there is a lot of material that supports what this film has to say.  And that makes it intriguing.  If you are curious about aliens the way I was after this film, then spend some time on the net and look up some stuff, you&apos;ll be surprised, but back to the film.\n\nD.B. Sweeney did a great job especially when he had to show fear.  He makes you feel that he was there and when you look into his eyes, you can feel his fear.  And that was one of the great parts of the film.  The actors from Peter Berg to Henry Thomas ( Elliot from E.T. ) do a credible job portraying his confused and interrogated-one-to-many-times friends.  But what the real strength of the film is, is the story.  It makes you open your eyes and ask some tough questions.  The story seems plausible, the boys passed every lie detector test, and there is no proof to say that they were lying.  So where does that leave you, the viewer?  It sealed my opinion on the subject.  And on that level it is a great film.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the film is that it seemed to end too abruptly.  There were so many questions I had that I wanted answered, but they just stopped.  And that left me frustrated.  I&apos;m not sure if they did that on purpose or if was unintentional, but it left me yearning for more. But that is the only glitch I had with the film.  If nothing else, it does make you question life.  And any film that can pose moral questions to me and not have me lose interest in the process has accomplished something. \n\n Do aliens exist?  I think so.  Watch this film and perhaps decide for yourself.",

So I bought the 2000 MGM DVD for $9.99. The movie is about a couple that moves into a new house, but little do they know, it is haunted. All of this was apparently a true story. Wonderful acting by Rod Stieger. This movie is not really a horror movie. It does not have the chills of a horror movie. The reason I never watched it was because I heard it was a bit of a bore. This movie is not what you may think it is. Don&apos;t go buying this if you think you will get a really scary movie. The DVD has a great picture. Probably a step up from the VHS version. If you are interested in the story of Amityville, then go out and get it. Do not expect a movie with blood and gore, because this movie is almost free of it. The 2000 DVD version is a bit of a disappointment in terms of features. Only the trailer is included. There are 8 sequels.\n\n6/10",

The mood in the first one is far more campy, almost cartoonish. The actual fear and horror mixed with that weird wink is perfect. &quot;The Devils Rejects&quot; on the other hand seems almost real. These people are out there...these people do not care about you or your children. Hell, they don&apos;t even care about your dog or furniture. The music, the angles, the complete disregard for the feelings of others. Blantant hedonism at it&apos;s best. Some folks walked out...I sat singing &quot;Free Bird&quot; till the screen went black. If it&apos;s for you, don&apos;t miss it. If you believe you are the least bit squeamish...go get that new direct to DVD Stitch movie!"

However, the story sometimes can lose you until it brings you on track.  The added plot info of Dracula having a lost love does work for a little while until Dracula starts to become a tragic villain where you pity him.  I personally feel that Keanu Reeves didn&apos;t do that bad of a job, but the character he played could have been given to a better actor.  All in all, this is the best Dracula adaption and movie to date.",

Besides appear Tom Savini, prestigious maker-up of Romero films and Carlos Gallardo, El Mariachi&apos;s starring , both playing two deputies.The motion picture is lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein(Dimension films), Rodriguez&apos;s usual producers. Moving musical score, special cinematography and nice direction by Robert Rodriguez. Rating : Above average, the film will like to terror fans with some humor and irony.",

If not for the studio trying to water this movie down, we might be talking about it with the likes of Hellraiser and Alien.\n\nI first saw this in the theater in 97 and it has only gotten better with time. Great sci-fi movie with traditional horror elements. The thunderstorms and fog add to the ambience.\n\nSam Neil and Laurence Fishburne give fantastic performances that are not reflected in the box office earnings.\n\nI wish we could see the original version that had test audiences fainting but apparently the film has been destroyed due to improper storage.\n\nHighly recommend.",

                "name": "Whale&apos;s First Masterpiece",
                "reviewBody": "After having been kicked out of school for his controversial work, Dr. Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) has been experimenting with the scientific forces behind the creation and perpetuation of life in his private laboratory. With the aid of his assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), Frankenstein finally tries his coup de grace--piecing together human parts to create a &quot;new&quot; life. When his experiments do not go exactly as planned, Frankenstein and his fellow villagers are endangered. \n\nLike a few other classics, director James Whale&apos;s 1931 masterpiece, Frankenstein, is one of those films that deserves to have every frame analyzed. Unlike most, Frankenstein is one of those classics that actually has had almost every frame analyzed. Countless theses and dissertations have been written about the film and its subtexts, so I can&apos;t imagine that I&apos;d add anything novel along those lines in the space provided here. Instead, I&apos;ll take a brief look at some of the more straightforward aspects of Frankenstein that, in my view, contribute to its masterpiece status. \n\nThe opening of the film has a very hefty dose of atmosphere, which continues more or less throughout its length. Although it was obviously filmed in a studio--the sky is a painted backdrop complete with wrinkles, this fact actually adds to the atmosphere of the film, even lending a slight surrealism. There is no score to speak of aside from the music playing during the titles, but the sounds that occur are just as effective, such as the ringing bell during the opening. There are also a lot of subtle visuals, and some merely subtly effective, such as the grim reaper at end of a long panning shot in the beginning of the film. \n\nThe seriousness and realism of the grave-digging scene, complete with Henry Frankenstein throwing dirt at the grim reaper, is beautiful foreshadowing. As in the rest of the film, there is nothing jokey about this situation. Watch how effectively the actors convey a sense of toiling and franticness, how they convey the &quot;weight&quot; of the coffin. This is a curious fact about the film overall. Although the material is relatively melodramatic, and occasionally extremely so (especially in the case of Henry Frankenstein), the performances always come across as serious and realistic rather than campy (with the possible exception of a single snarling &quot;growl&quot; from the monster when he encounters Elizabeth, Frankenstein&apos;s bride-to-be). Contrast this to how Tod Browning&apos;s Dracula plays in the present day. In that film, Lugosi--although I love his performance--does come across as occasionally campy, especially in the close-ups of his &quot;hypnotically staring&quot; eyes. Even the one character that is meant to give some light comic relief, that of Frankenstein&apos;s father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr), is comic only in that the character is a bit sarcastic, with a dry sense of humor. As such, Kerr portrays the Baron seriously, also.\n\nThe production and set design, as in the sequel, Bride of Frankenstein (1935), adds volumes to the atmosphere and beauty of the film. The interior of the &quot;watchtower&quot;, where Frankenstein&apos;s private laboratory is located, is reminiscent of German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and they both contrast and cohere wonderfully with the more symmetrical, right-angled lab equipment constructed by Kenneth Strickfaden.\n\nBecause there is no score, the actors have no help in amping up the emotions in their performances. Despite this, rarely has either Boris Karloff&apos;s monster or Colin Clive&apos;s mad doctor been matched. Whale helps with some ingenious shots and sequences, such as the &quot;progressive close-ups&quot; when we first see the monster. He also gives us a number of &quot;stage-like&quot; devices that work remarkably well, such as the pans through cutaways in the set that in the film&apos;s world do not really exist. Interestingly, Whale has still had the cutaways decorated as if they are extant in the film&apos;s world. Although they may seem dated now, Whale&apos;s technique of fading to black between scenes also amplifies the sense of &quot;literary chapters&quot; in the story, and gives an effective, ambiguous sense of time passage between the scenes.\n\nWhale also achieves some wonderful, more understated scenes of horror in the film, often set up by contrasts. For example the severe contrast of the villager walking into the wedding party with his daughter, and the surreal bucolic adventure of the villagers working their way through the countryside to find the monster. \n\nMany younger viewers might have a difficult time watching Frankenstein if they are not used to black &amp; white, slower paced, understated films with a different approach to acting. These classics are an acquired taste for younger generations, but of course it&apos;s a taste worth acquiring.",

                "reviewBody": "It&apos;s almost impossible not to love &apos;Dracula&apos;, a horror milestone that is the most important and influential vampire movie ever made. Bela Lugosi became a cinematic legend after this movie, and his portrayal of Dracula basically invented the modern vampire as we know it. Murnau&apos;s silent classic &apos;Nosferatu&apos; was an obvious influence on Todd Browning, but while Browning was no James Whale (the innovative British director who made &apos;Frankenstein&apos; for Universal a few months after this) he added a lot of his own style and ideas to the project, and Counts Orloff and Dracula are completely different kinds of creatures. Lugosi made his Count sophisticated, attractive and sexy, and this is what made this movie such a sensation at the time, and what helps make it still a wonderful viewing experience. Lugosi&apos;s performance is one of the greatest in horror history. Some of the other actors in the cast are a bit shaky but Edward Van Sloan as Van Hesling is excellent and Dwight Frye&apos;s Renfield (a different character from the book) is also memorable. Both actors would reappear in &apos;Frankenstein&apos;. &apos;Dracula&apos; is an important landmark horror movie, but even better, is still a fantastic viewing experience seventy years later. Don&apos;t just watch it because it&apos;s a classic, watch it because it&apos;s wonderful entertainment!"

                "reviewBody": "It wasn&apos;t the first werewolf movie (that honor goes to `Werewolf of London&apos;), but it was `The Wolf Man&apos; that gives us most of the werewolf mythology we still cling to today.\n\nAs with most classics, `The Wolf Man&apos; draws its power from a combination of elements.  First, there&apos;s Curt Siodmak&apos;s plausible and intelligent script. Siodmak said he was given a title, a star and a start date, and from there he consolidated and invented the werewolf myth into a cohesive, logical format.\n\nThen there&apos;s the actors, a veritable who&apos;s who of 1930s-40s Universal horror.  Lon Chaney joins the pantheon on great horror actors on this one, playing the tormented Larry Talbot.  He manages to give Larry a tragic quality, a man trapped by a curse he doesn&apos;t understand or deserve.  Chaney also generates considerable chemistry with the luminous Evelyn Ankers, which is surprising considering the rumors that the two practically hated each other.  And then there&apos;s the always-excellent Claude Rains, who doesn&apos;t look very much like Lon Chaney&apos;s father, but still exudes quiet authority and authenticity.\n\nTopping off the whole package is a healthy dollop of atmosphere: foggy forests, Gothic mansions and crypts, colorful Gypsy encampments.  Each bit of design enhances the sense of mystery and dread that surround Larry Talbot, and burns `The Wolf Man&apos; into your memory.\n\nI&apos;ll never walk a foggy forest at night again!"

I know a lot of people won&apos;t be able to see it for what it is because of the supernatural/horror elements (which are usually a turn-off for film snobs), but the movie is just extremely well-made.\n\nConsider the fact that Linney&apos;s character&apos;s true conflict is not winning the trial, but a satisfyingly complex internal struggle which I will not name so as not to spoil the movie. Or the plethora of food for thought that the movie offers, regarding existentialist issues of perception vs. objective truth, and social issues of liability and responsibility.\n\nSome very interesting scenes that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible and ballsy performance by Jennifer Carpenter, which takes Linda Blair&apos;s possession to a whole new level. Also, notice how a key dramatic monologue is presented, contrary to what we might expect, with no sentimental music in the background. The cinematography is also great. I was reminded of Dario Argento&apos;s vivid colors in Suspiria on more than one occasion.\n\nAlthough it&apos;s not the focus of the film, the movie also offers a few very cool scare moments, and seeing Emily possessed is terrifying.\n\nThis is my favorite &quot;underdog&quot; movie of the year so far.",

However, I stopped watching him after the Happening, (which was really quite a terrible movie. No comment on The Last Airbender). \n\nThis is such a wonderful comeback. His ability to totally freak you out without being terrifying; to keep you fascinated, yet completely confused, it&apos;s all just so much fun! Not sure how his films can be so slow yet so gripping and FUN! \n\nThis one is bang on. The cinematography is wonderful, the story is intense and gripping. Not to mention that James Macavoy is bang on (what a great performance, love Joaquin Phoenix, but not sure he would have been quite so awesomely intense as Macavoy was). \n\nI highly recommend this film to any thriller lovers and a must for any M.Night lovers (but I don&apos;t need to say that at this point now, do I). I agree it&apos;s not a horror film but it does very get under your skin. (If you found The Ring too much, don&apos;t watch this!) \n\nHowever, if you loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, this is a must see!! \n\nCan&apos;t wait to see Glass.",

                "reviewBody": "ABC broadcast this film as a Sunday Night Movie in, I believe, 1965.  I watched it with my best friend at his house, which happened to be next door. After the movie was over I was afraid to walk home.  Thirty eight years later, this movie is still the scariest movie I&apos;ve ever seen.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to put into words why this movie triggers such an emotional response.  There is no blood and gore, no creatures or monsters in plain sight.  In fact, there is very little physical presence in this movie that should evoke such a fear reaction.  True, there are multiple angle exterior shots of the mansion that make one feel as if the house is watching them all the time.  And there are loud unexplained noises, bulging wall panels, and door knobs that turn by themselves.  All-in-all, the physical evidence is pretty tame, especially by today&apos;s standards.\n\nThe fear reaction lies not in the physical form, but in the psychological sense.  For example, as Theo and Nell cling to one another as wall pounding draws closer to their room, only to stop and dead silence replaces the noise.  Later in the movie, Nell and Theo are again in their room when Nell grabs hold of Theo&apos;s hand as noise begins to build outside their bedroom door.  Finally, unable to stand the noise  any longer, Nell begins to scream which awakens Theo, who happens to be halfway across the room, and thus not close enough to be holding Nell&apos;s hand.  So the question is &quot;who or what was Nell holding?&quot;.  There are many scenes that are similar to the above.\n\n This film was directed by Robert Wise who made me believe there was something lurking around every corner, or there was something that was going to happen, but you just didn&apos;t know quite when.  This is the type of directing that has given this movie the classic status it so richly deserves.\n\nSo, if you are more into the physical style of a movie, go see &quot;Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;, but if you are ready for a genuinely scary movie, go rent or buy the 1963 version of &quot;The Haunting&quot;.",

                "reviewBody": "It&apos;s been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It&apos;s utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is &quot;dullsville&quot; compared to this re-make.\n\nThings can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum (&apos;Seth Brundle&quot;) slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend&apos;s anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums&apos; incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as &quot;Veronica Quiafe.&quot;\n\nThe story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don&apos;t Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, &quot;Stathis Borans.&quot; Those three characters dominate the film. I can&apos;t even remember anyone else in here.\n\nThe ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the nd, this movie will have you emotionally worn out.",

Not only does he not fit in with the local residents, but he also has an uncontrollable fear of spiders which are prevalent in the surrounding area. To make matters worse, a new, lethal breed of spider has made its way from South America to their hometown, and produced far more deadly offspring that are slowly taking over their peaceful little community. Exciting, creepy-crawly thriller with first-rate special effects, hair-raising chills, and an excellent cast. Even with the welcomed comedic overtones this is not for the squeamish or anyone with the titular fear, especially at the film&apos;s nail-biting finale. ***"

Most of the action takes place in a broken down car in the countryside during a super hot day as a big dirty, and very angry dog tries to attack and kill a poor young kid and his mother. The attacks themselves are really quite brutal and very well put together as the main characters really do go through hell and back with this rabid pooch. This is one of the better animal attack films that has for some unknown reason been more than a little bit forgotten about. Put this on if your kid wants to watch one of the terrible Beethoven sequels for the 100th time.",

Simple, or so Frank thought.\n\nWhat results is a cinematic masterpiece, a great mix of gore and violence, as well as a great musical score and some nice drama.  The acting is fine, but there are imperfections. One common complaint: The characters are not pleasant enough we can latch onto them.  Maybe that&apos;s because these seem more realistic than the characters we CAN latch onto.  Just a thought, don&apos;t jump on this.\n\nWhat really gets me, though, is the people calling it down, saying it&apos;s not quality entertainment.  Come on guys, if it was SUPPOSED to be Shakespeare, it would not advertise as being able to &quot;tear your soul apart.&quot;\n\nThe presence of the cenobites was originally intended not to carry the story but to emphasize it.  As usual, the sequaes ignored it.  Hey, merchandizing.\n\nThis is the only one of the series that depends on the story more than the demons.  We hardly ever see the infamous Pinhead at all.\n\nall in all, this was a fun movie.  No Shakespeare, but it&apos;s not supposed to be.  Just dramatic, gory, groundbreaking horror, delivered to us excellently by Mr. Barker."

NOSFERATU is arguably the earliest surviving screen version depicting the &apos;Prince of Darkness&apos;. This German production deviates slightly from the original, but the now familiar story we all know by heart is intact. Count Dracula becomes Count Orlok and journeys to Bremen, Germany instead of London. His physical appearance is not dashing, mesmerizing or even mystical; but much resembles the rats that frequently accompany him. I find this the most eerie of all that would follow. The accompanying organ music background makes this scratchy black and white silent film an essential masterpiece. Max Schreck is immortal as Nosferatu/Count Orlok.",

I had no idea what to expect from this movie going in all I knew was it was a vampire movie.\n\nSchumacher created a fun and vibrant little town and I enjoyed it, the movie was cast really well and this is what a vampire movie should feel like in my opinion.\n\nThe score and visuals hold up ! I really like the costumes too. I think the kids were definitely the show grabbers for me. They were funny and acted business as usual which I found entertaining too.\n\nI found it odd that people were basically aware of the vampires and nothing was done about it\n\nThe movie isn&apos;t perfect but it is fun and I do recommend seeing it to judge for yourself.",

                "reviewBody": "An American Werewolf in London is a 1981 horror comedy film written and directed by John Landis. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, the film stars David Naughton, Jenny Agutter, and Griffin Dunne. The film&apos;s plot follows two American backpackers, David and Jack, who are attacked by a creature while traveling in England, causing David to question whether he will become a werewolf under the next full moon.\n\nAfter watching an American Werewolf in London for the first time I found the film to be a clever mixture of comedy and horror which succeeds in being both funny and scary, The film possesses an overriding eagerness to please that prevents it from becoming off-putting. It delivers a good share of scares and dark laughs. Some of the special effects are a little creaky now, but the snap of Landis&apos;s editing and the razor&apos;s-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh. The metamorphoses into the werewolf scenes are spectacular and the beast&apos;s rampage through Piccadilly Circus is marvellous. Splendid gory fun. It feels increasingly like a symbol of traveller abroad alienation-what trying to live in a place that isn&apos;t home can feel like: confusing, rageful, even physically debilitating.",

It has a remarkably funny gun crazed survivalist couple played completely straight-faced by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire. It has a wonderfully batty bunch of &quot;townsfolk,&quot; a winsome heroine and bad lot of underground drag racing worms looking to eat the characters mentioned above. The movie stands out from the &quot;trapped and pursued&quot; genre because it contains tongue-in-cheek humor, comedic escapes, inspired foreshadowing of doom and nutty monster mayhem. This is a delightful B monster movie that would best be watched with fellow funny movie buffs, popcorn and beer.",

I will not say that this will be the greatest horror movie ever but the cinematography is great and makes the whole mundane plot seems interesting and manage to crap the hell out of me.\n\nI hate it when some so-called horror movies use old cheap tricks like the creepy music or sound effects to compensate their poor performance. I watched many scary movies and Insidious is the one that really made it sound and seems so real that it allows audience relate to it. I was expecting to see some people died in horrible way where their guts and bloods are everywhere and floor splashed with red tomato juices. You&apos;ll never have to see that kind of scene in here, they keep it as close as possible for you to relate in your real life and in your room while you are struggling to sleep.",

                "reviewBody": "I find silent films more eerie than the talking B&amp;W horror films (Dracula, Frankenstien, the Thing from Another World) and also more eerie than the modern color films (Suspiria, Ju-on, the Descent). The exaggeration in the actors gestures and expressions; the early camera technology that&apos;s not quite fluid and not quite clear; the tinted colors; and an artificially overlaid soundtrack \u0096 it all combines and adds up to paint an abstract and unnatural picture.\n\nCinema has evolved so far since the Silent Era that watching these films is almost like glimpsing into another world completely unrelated to the one most of us grew up watching. And I find it fascinating that this is, indeed, the ancestor to many horror films that I adore today. So, like with other classics, I viewed Phantom of the Opera with the delight of discovering our cinematic horror roots \u0096 seeing the predecessor to Jack Pierce, Rick Baker, and Stan Winston in action, watching the precursor to John Carpenter, Mario Bava, and David Cronenberg.\n\nFrom the opening scene, Phantom of the Opera makes great use of shadows. A character with a lantern wanders the labyrinth below the Paris Opera house, ducking into an alcove as the shadow of the Phantom passes. Barring a handful of shots showing a cloaked figure from behind (or from a distance), this motif continues as Erik, the Phantom, is represented as a shadow, calling to Christine from the catacombs behind her dressing room mirror until she inevitably comes face to face with the mask (which she will inevitably remove.) Even though I&apos;m quite familiar with the face of Lon Chaney&apos;s Phantom from the numerous still-shots out there, I still felt the pulse of anxiety and suspense when that famous moment drew near. Though blatantly exploitive in its camera angle, the timing, the expression on Chaney&apos;s face, though it aims purely for spectacle and shock for the audience of 1925, it carries something newer spectacles/shock-films lack: charm.\n\nI couldn&apos;t help but smile watching Chaney&apos;s haunting performance beneath that famous makeup, seeing it animated for the first time, the sadness and tragedy that underlines the phantoms soul. He moves with a precision and deliberateness that&apos;s not entirely natural, but remains paradoxically sincere. The rooftop scene, in particular, where Christine and Raoul plot, oblivious to the presence of the unmasked phantom who listens in with great intensity from his perch above \u0096 gripping his cape in his heartbroken state, eventually throwing himself back into the grasp of the statue in disbelieving defeat.\n\nThere&apos;s something both awkward and poetic to the movements of the actors as they express their emotions not in subtleties, but rather in exaggerated body language that almost feels at home here (almost, but not quite.) Early in the film, frightened ballerinas spontaneously spin in place (one revolution) as a visual representation of their anxiety. Somewhat silly, but simultaneously delightful in its approach.\n\nLater in the film, Christine rejects the Phantom, arcing her back to its limit, her face turned as far away as possible, with her hands outstretched as if the very air around Erik would prove toxic. A single still frame presented to an audience, completely isolated from the context of the rest of the film, would leave absolutely no room for misinterpretations.\n\nThe film goes on to a larger scope and bigger thrills with the inevitable fall of the chandelier, the Phantom&apos;s many tricks and traps in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House, and the final pursuit where the mob chases Erik through the streets of Paris -- the film strains itself to outdo all the silent films that came before. However, it strains too far, and I find myself liking the film in its quieter, more personal, exploits (the phantom in the shadows, the unmasking, the rooftop.) I do have to comment on the end of the film, though: Erik has been cornered and surrounded on all sides by the angry mob. He raises up a closed fist threateningly, as though within his grasp lay one final card that could level the playing field -- an explosive of some type -- and the crowd visibly hesitates, backing off. After a dramatic pause, the Phantom opens his hand to reveal he&apos;s holding nothing at all.\n\nThen we realize the film, itself, has done the very same thing. For the length of its running time it convinces you it held something -- some kind of awe-inspiring trick up its sleeve. Thus the problem with all exploitation films, but you have to admire Phantom for how it sustains so little for so long and makes you smile after you realize the truth.\n\nLike a good magic trick."

                "reviewBody": "A dark and meticulous tale, based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It&apos;s such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I&apos;m talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters, and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn&apos;t stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes. \n\nWhy did I enjoy this film, I hear you ask? For a start, the direction was superb - the streets of London looked grimy, while the `unfortunates&apos; (i.e., prostitutes) wandered around in squalor awaiting their fate. This produced a wonderful atmosphere, creating murder scenes that were much more terrifying and shocking (and very gruesome). Johnny Depp&apos;s performance (as the detective Abberline), as always, was hugely enjoyable to watch. He played his character in a very subtle way - halfway between comic and serious. He portrays a desperate man, constantly resorting to drugs so he can pass through the day. Depp and the filmmakers see him as a version of Sherlock Holmes, constantly finding clues that other police officers have overlooked (cliched, yes, but somehow Depp provides a little bit of originality). Abberline even suggests that the killer must be a learned man! How could this be?! While dismissed by all the other characters in the film (for a learned man would never commit acts of such debauchery), we as an audience know better not to trust a detective like this - their preposterous ideas are usually right. Another actor to praise in this is the wonderful Ian Holm. He plays his character with a wry little smile, seemingly enjoying every line he says. His interactions with Depp are great to watch.\n\nWhile the film provides little to ponder on once the credits have rolled, you can leave satisfied that you have seen a stylish and enjoyable film. The Hughes brothers seem to be a talented pair of directors.\n\nFor those that care I gave this film 7/10",

After her family turned into Zombies , the protagonist (Sarah Polley) escapes and she meets a hunk deputy man (Ving Rhames) , a marriage (formed by Mekhi Phifer and his pregnant wife) , a security guard (Michael Kelly) and others . They will find shelter at a mall . They&apos;ll have to confront lots of Zombies starving of human meat. When the undead rise, civilization will fall. When there&apos;s no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth. 36 billion people have died since the reign of humanity. For the new Dawn, there&apos;s a reunion...How do you kill what&apos;s already dead?\n\n\u00a8Dawn of the dead\u00a8 is an outstanding horror movie , it is realized in fast-moving and is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining and creepy . From start to finish the grisly action-packed is continued . The picture blends horror, suspense , tension , violence and great loads of blood and gore . The motion picture takes part of \u00a8Dawn of the dead\u00a8 (the screenwriter is George A. Romero) and \u00a8Resident evil : Apocalypse\u00a8 , too . This version is technically better than the original , because being more spectacular and thrilling . Special effects , FX , are first-rate , they have been realized by means of computer generator and the eerie Zombies transformed into flesh eating are made by means of a top-notch make-up .\n\nThe film obtained success at the boxoffice and was a real blockbuster in spite of the crude theme . The film is rated + 18 years for the scary murders and violence and isn&apos;t apt for boys , neither squeamish. The yarn will appeal to terror and gore enthusiasts . Rating : Good, above average.",

                "reviewBody": "This movie is a clear step above most horror movies. It helps raise the bar for all horror movies by simply having a nice mix of movie elements that work well together.\n\nBasically, the movie is about three American college guys who venture out of Amsterdam and into a region of Slovakia looking for more extreme female interaction. Once they arrive, they begin to suspect that everything may not be as good as it seems when one by one they start disappearing.\n\nAlthough this seems like a typical horror plot, the movie is well-done and believable. The European scenery, interesting characters, decent dialog and fast-moving pace of the movie completely separate it from the typical &quot;waste of time&quot; horror movies.\n\nI also give the director high marks for not making this a gore-fest and overfocusing on nothing but blood and guts. The result is that he has created a real movie - and a good one.\n\nThis is a pretty decent horror flick. If you&apos;re in the mood for this kind of movie and don&apos;t want a mindless slasher-fest, this will do nicely.",

                "reviewBody": "On a road-trip through the New Mexico desert, a family stranded in the area finds that a group of inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies have targeted the group and are set on killing them for food, forcing the family into a desperate race to stop them and get away alive.\n\nThis here was quite the fun if slightly flawed effort. When this one works, it&apos;s mainly due to the fact that there&apos;s quite an effective atmosphere here of being out alone in the wilderness. The film does an incredible job in the first half of depicting the desert of this one as creepy and chilling which really makes it so that being trapped on an open road in the middle of nowhere is a pretty terrifying ordeal and forces the ultimate traveling nightmare. The darkness that surrounds the family is terrifying, as anyone or anything can hide in there, and this film provides that fear in spades as tons of times we see or hear all these sights and sounds that would terrify any sane person. That gets exemplified best in the one scene of the characters run down the highway in the dark as these crazy laughs were heard echoing alongside him, a pretty terrifying ordeal, and it only gets better from there. That comes from the rather impressive event that kick-starts the film into overdrive which is the main assault on the van as the family gets into attacking the trapped members during an insanely fun ploy here, as the mounting tension plays into the initial first trap before the charge into the van and all the battles to confront them attempting to escape as well as one of the most horrendous acts ever committed to screen, and the audacity to pull it off and make it as striking as it is a huge testament to do something like that. By subjecting us to this scene, it works to keep the audience on the edge because now we don&apos;t know what else will be thrown at us and become anxious as the waiting game begins. The best part is the events that follow as the film is all action featuring plenty of solid action as the brutal encounters offer a lot of great moments. Also great is the family has a creepy air around them that makes us all become scared of them, and along with their great behavior patterns are the best parts. It doesn&apos;t have too many flaws here as the main issue is the illogical manner of getting them on the shortcut which really makes no sense and features plenty of stupid character decisions to move them along. There&apos;s also the manner of the rather sloppier effects for the gore and kills which does take away a bit of their effectiveness. Otherwise, this is quite an enjoyable effort.\n\nRated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, attempted rape, violence-against-animals and children-in-jeopardy.",

                "reviewBody": "One of few truly great &quot;creature&quot; films, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON is a surprisingly effective horror film concerning a scientific expedition up the Amazon to investigate an unusual fossil find--but instead of fossils the crew members encounter an underwater creature of considerable intelligence that is bent on their destruction.\n\nThe script is a bit dated by modern standards, but the cast (particularly Julie Adams) is effective, and the creature is easily one of Universal Studio&apos;s most memorable creations. And seen today in standard black and white, the film is quite enjoyable. But it doesn&apos;t hold a candle to the original 3-D format, which I was fortunate to see not once but twice during the 1970s and 1980s. Simply stated, BLACK LAGOON&apos;s cinematography was probably the best of all 3-D movies to date. As with most 3-D films, there is plenty of &quot;coming at you&quot; cinematography, and many viewers will be able to pick out such moments when seeing the film in standard black and white--but in addition to these, the film used 3-D in a remarkably subtle way; virtually every scene in the film is designed for 3-D, and the effect is exceptionally memorable in the underwater sequences.\n\nI remain disappointed that the 3-D version of BLACK LAGOON--not to mention such other 3-D films as HOUSE OF WAX, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, and DIAL &quot;M&quot; FOR MURDER--has never been released in 3-D format on video or disk; instead, we must make do with such bottom-budget 3-D flicks as THE MASK, CAT WOMEN ON THE MOON, and the like. Admittedly, the impact of the format is lessened by the small screen and demands some careful color adjusting, and the effect requires the use of 3-D glasses--but it is a shame that we must settle for ghosts of the originals when we could easily have the originals instead. In 3-D format, BLACK LAGOON would easily be a ten-star film.\n\nGary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

                "reviewBody": "An amusing take on the low-budget monster movies of the seventies, this is also a kind of follow-up to the Alligator movies of the early eighties. It wasn&apos;t a success, maybe due to the title - potential viewers may think it&apos;s a documentary about a lake - but is consistently humorous, thanks to a good cast. Fonda, as a paleontologist sent to investigate a sudden death by large teeth on the lake in question, is purposely irritating in the &apos;fish out of water&apos; role. She reveals a surprising knack for comedy, the city girl from New Yawk stuck in the forest. Platt &amp; Gleeson squabble like two long-lost overweight brothers as respectfully, eccentric millionaire &amp; sheriff. Platt is always funny, and Gleeson matches him here. Pullman makes less of an impression, underplaying as the guy in charge. Betty White is a hoot as the foul-mouthed local old lady with a secret.\n\nThe monster in question, a 30-foot croc, stays out of sight for the first half-hour and when it does appear, it&apos;s strangely unsurprising, despite the suddenness. It&apos;s as if we&apos;ve seen so many of these &apos;large animal&apos; pictures by this point, this is just another one in a long line. It&apos;s a weird money shot as well, involving a growling bear, and is not as effective as it should be. Thanks to modern special FX, computer and otherwise, the croc is better realized than those of 20 years earlier. But that could be a problem: integrated into the wilderness like any other animal, there&apos;s nothing about the creature, despite its size, to inspire awe or real terror. It&apos;s just a big crocodile, after all. Like &quot;Anaconda&quot;, this inspired a slew of big croc &amp; alligator movies for the Sci-Fi Channel. UPDATE: Speaking of which, a sequel came out on the SF channel in late April, 2007.",

                "reviewBody": "`Candyman&apos; is a very frightening and yet intriguing and compelling movie that plays upon and cleverly manipulates old urban legends and myths of folklore and brings to life some of your worst nightmares and horrors. As far as scary movies go it falls into a category of its own in terms of its depth and excellence\n\nOne of the main strengths of this movie is that the script and the character performances are so powerful and credible that it doesn&apos;t feel the need to inject unnecessary horror/graphic/violent scenes into it to sensationalize it. Sure, there is an extensive amount of blood and gore in the movie but it nevertheless fits in with the plot and isn&apos;t added in just to give the film an unnecessary `horror&apos; feel. The chilling and terrifying aspects of this movie come from the dialogue, the sequence of events and the emotions and personas revealed in the characters. The plot and the script is enough to leave you mesmerized throughout the whole movie and to remain on the edge of your seat with the anticipation of what is going to happen next. The producers and scriptwriters must receive top marks for the wonderful way in which they enriched the whole movie by relying on the script and the acting instead of adding cheap gimmicks into it to make it more frightening. In addition to that the lighting and the scenery around the whole movie makes it even more frightening\n\nI have always thought Virginia Madsen to be a highly talented, qualified and excellent actress whose wonderful acting and gifted performances have been consistently overlooked when allocating movie roles. For me `Candyman&apos; confirmed this thesis. Her portrayal of Helen Lyle is truly one of the most excellent portrayals of a character I have seen recently. She gives her character so much depth, dimension and genuine emotions. Tony Todd also emerges from this film as a very talented and wonderful actor. The amount of depth, dimension and persona that he gives to the character of the `Candyman&apos; is amazing. Although the Candyman is in many ways a truly evil and frightening character, you also can&apos;t help but feel a great deal of sympathy for him at times and this too is a testament to Todd&apos;s acting. The supporting cast \u0096particularly Vanessa Williams and even the young kid who Helen interviews while in the neighbourhood-also deserve an honourable mention for giving their characters such a realistic edge.\n\nI would recommend this movie \u0096it is chilling, frightening, intriguing, compelling, sad and wonderful all in one. One of the best movies I have ever seen in this genre"

The scattershot breakneck pace makes fellow monster maven Sam Raimi look like Busby Berkeley!  Classic cult film that will have you laughing at the putridness of it all.  Look for Jackson&apos;s homage to &quot;King Kong&quot; with Skull Island reference at film&apos;s precredit sequence."

                "reviewBody": "&apos;Interview with the Vampire&apos; is an atmospheric, highly gripping &quot;film involving vampires&quot; - not a &quot;vampire movie&quot;. Whilst the latter would describe a film that focuses on its vampirism and might be judged on the sharpness of its fangs, this &quot;film involving vampires&quot; has all the merits of the very best cinema, and at its core is nothing but a fantastic story carried by compelling, believable characters.\n\nFor those who may not be able to overlook the vampiric content, look again. The vampirism herein is a plot device, a way of presenting characters who cannot die or age or be harmed, so that the philosophical questions of life itself can be explored. But equally, for those who will be interested in the vampiric content, this film presents a rich mythology backed by a trilogy of books, which fleshes out the concept of the vampire in a much deeper way than any other production.\n\nEvery person has their own world view, their own way of living and thinking. People can be brooding, contemplative, cautious, reasonable, carefree, hedonistic, optimistic, emotional - and every shade in between. But these are all world-views based on the knowledge that life is short. What would happen if told their lives would never end? Who would be happiest? What would they do? How would eternal life affect each person? And most importantly, if a way of living was bringing meaning to a person&apos;s life, would that still work once life was infinite? All of these questions help us explore philosophical ideas as old as time, and that exploration is the focus of this film.\n\nThe story is propelled by vampires Louis (Pitt) and Lestat (Cruise), each representing a different take on life. Whilst Louis, who began as a depressive wanting to die, thinks of eternity as an extended curse; Lestat, who seems to live every second as it comes, barely even considers the future three minutes hence. Told from Louis&apos; viewpoint as he struggles to find some meaning in a life he knows will never end, we are taken on a ride across the centuries, as Louis&apos; outlook and happiness undulate whilst characters and relationships come and go.\n\nAlongside Louis&apos; turmoil in coming to terms with his (now eternal) life, a secondary theme is explored, which is the notion of survival. Even though Louis is clearly dissatisfied with life, he never attempts to end it, despite this option being open to him. In other words, surviving, in and of itself, was a motivation that outdid any other. Most importantly, survival outdoes Louis&apos; trouble over the fact that his only source of nourishment is now the blood of living animals, preferably humans. Despite attempting abstinence, and then attempting to drink only the blood of rodents, this basic feeding instinct proves too much for Louis. And yet, as Lestat points out, what is the problem? The fittest always survives, and whoever is lower down the food-chain will be eaten. Humans eat animals, and vampires eat humans - it&apos;s all natural. But nonetheless, are there moral limits? Even if you have to kill a human, is there a more moral way to do it? &quot;Monstrous,&quot; Louis exclaims, as he watches a group of vampires murder a defenceless girl. Yet might survival require the forgetting of moral consciousness, like Lestat?\n\n&apos;Interview with the Vampire&apos; explores all of these deep, important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters, haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue. Gripping from start to finish, you will be enamoured at the vampire-world opened up to you; and by the end, you are left wondering what choice you would have made, given the one that Lestat never had...",

                "reviewBody": "The girls of a sorority house are being tormented by a twisted prank caller who continually calls to convey increasingly vile and abusive sentiments. What at first appears to be a sick joke eventually turns violent for the girls during the season of supposed goodwill and merriment.\n\nThe original and maybe even the best, \u0091Black Christmas&apos; set the ball rolling for the slasher genre and was the biggest influence for the phenomenally successful John Carpenter classic, \u0091Halloween&apos; (1978), which was, in fact, originally conceived as a sequel. Although Italian director, Mario Bava, had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie, \u0091Bay of Blood&apos; (1971), it was \u0091Black Christmas&apos; that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative sub-genres of horror cinema. Bob Clark (who previously made the kooky, enjoyable, low-budget zombie film \u0091Children Shouldn&apos;t Play With Dead Things&apos; (1972)), still at this point something of an amateur director, took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nerve-wracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as \u0091The Haunting&apos; (1963) and \u0091Alien&apos; (1979) are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by \u0091Black Christmas&apos;.\n\nThe simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely, comic-book style events; the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudo-claustrophobic environment of the sorority house, from where the vast majority of events occur, offers the perfect, vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented; even at the very end, very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity, \u0091Black Christmas&apos; has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways, the concealing of several key points puts the viewer&apos;s knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.\n\n\u0091Black Christmas&apos; is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget, this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as \u0091Halloween&apos;, \u0091Friday the 13th&apos; (1980), Slumber Party Massacre (1982) and \u0091The House on Sorority Row&apos; (1983) should be able to spot several of the now-clich\u00e9s that first materialized in \u0091Black Christmas&apos;. My rating for \u0091Black Christmas&apos; - 8\u00bd/10.",

They find a prostitute (Sheryl Lee) bitten by Valek and, using her telepathic link to the vampire, they try to track him down.\n\nJames Woods is really the whole show, hamming it up like the expected Carpenter cheesy macho anti-hero. Sheryl Lee is surprisingly good, as well. The worst casting is that of Thomas Ian Griffith as the villain. He&apos;s very much a post-Lestat romantic goth douchebag Dracula wannabe. Nothing frightening or exciting about him. More F bombs than a movie without Chris Tucker should probably have. This is John Carpenter&apos;s last above-average movie. It&apos;s still not a patch on his classics but it&apos;s entertaining enough.",

                "reviewBody": "Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn&apos;t really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino&apos;s homage to the &quot;splatstick&quot; genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn&apos;t so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.\n\nFor the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-&apos;n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino&apos;s script is just the baseline for it all. It&apos;s like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film&apos;s DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn&apos;t in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.\n\nAnd in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez&apos; DESPERADO, it&apos;s a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.\n\nSo no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that&apos;s not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.\n\nAnd they succeeded. It&apos;s entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.",

                "reviewBody": "It&apos;s surprising that John Carpenter followed up Halloween with such a different tale of terror, but he did just that with 1980&apos;s The Fog. It&apos;s a urban legend-simple ghost story about a small coastal town celebrating its anniversary, forgetting that they only claimed the town because they murdered a shipful of lepers. The lepers are back and they want revenge.\n\nThe Fog has an excellent ensemble cast which is one of its strong suits and also, perhaps, one of its downfalls. There&apos;s really no major main character (even Adrienne Barbeau&apos;s Stevie Wayne - a radio DJ - disappears for large chunks of the film and never interacts with most of the other characters in the film). It&apos;s almost like if Robert Altman decided to make an ensemble horror film. Even more surprising is that Jamie Lee Curtis, Carpenter&apos;s star of Halloween, is in only about 15 to 20 minutes of the film and has no real character to speak of.\n\nDean Cundey&apos;s cinematography stuns and Carpenter&apos;s eerie synth score spooks, but one can&apos;t help feel that something is missing. It does lack that visceral thrill that made Halloween so special. The Fog seems content to just creep its audience out and not truly scare them. It&apos;s hard to complain, though, since The Fog does creepy better than just about any other film I can think of. It won&apos;t make you come back home and turn all the lights on before bed, but it still stays with you.",

                "reviewBody": "I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and how scary it was to me, especially the scene where Nora sees the old lady ghost for the first time. I haven&apos;t seen this movie since I was 6 years old and I remember watching with my mom recently the &quot;100 scariest movies&quot; on BRAVO and this movie was mentioned, I figured since I had the opportunity to see it again, why not? Like I said, it&apos;s somewhat lost it&apos;s edge, but still &apos;till this day, House on Haunted Hill will always remain a great movie to watch any stormy night.\n\nFive strangers have been invited to a house on Haunted Hill, they are being offered by Vincent price $10,000 each, the catch? They have to spend the night at that house that has been cursed, thinking it&apos;s just a good old fashioned haunted party that Vincent&apos;s wife is throwing, they go along with it, especially since they could easily have $10,000. But things start to go a little crazy when horrible things happen to the guests, including the sights of ghosts. But questions are brought up when the wife seems pretty up on loosing her millionaire husband.\n\nThe story was great and the ending was one of the first great twist endings of our time. Again, I could always easily laugh at some scenes now a days, but I think it is because of the fact that I&apos;ve seen so many horror movies. Because I still remember those horrible nightmares this movie gave me as a kid and that&apos;s what makes this movie special to me, it will remain as the greatest sleepover flick! \n\n7/10",

                "reviewBody": "When this film came out I was in the Army Basic training, and back then a new recruit was completely cut from the rest of the world. I only learned about this film because I hear about it from someone else. I had zero knowledge about the sleazy marketing campaign.\n\nAs we were going to the movies. I heard that this was supposed to be a real found documentary from three missing young film makers. I hate to say this, but you have to have been an idiot back in 1999 to believe this. I know that back then the internet was still considered for weirdos and friendless dorks. Still, there is no such thing as witches or ghosts....so yeah, apparently there are a lot of stupids roaming in cars in our communities.\n\nWhen I watched I absolutely loved it, and thought it was very scary, and it gave me the shivers. The Blair Witch Project is obviously not made for the contemporary audience, especially for the younger audience of today. For several reasons, one is that I think the young audience, has already seen plenty of movies made in a faux documentary stile...but this was the 1st for me, and the audience of when this movie first came out.\n\nBut, I suspect there is another reason why this movie is much less favorably received, buy the audience of today. You see, back in 1999 when you are 18 or 20 years old. Children, were not addicted to their phones, video games, and a cornucopia of crap to watch on streaming services.\n\nWe at that time spent a lot of time outdoors, camping, hiking, and without the aid of hand held GPS devices or cell phones. This is where The Blair Witch Project shines. Back then it was a real possibility get lost in the woods, without the aid of tech such as simply calling for help anytime you like. Even getting lost in your car could be quite an experience, as in locating a gas station and having to rely on strangers with strange dialects for direction.\n\nBeing alone in your tent in the night without any quick support, things breaking outside your tent, leaves falling and scraping the tent exterior, and animals making strange sounds, was a real cause for alarm. And this type of experience really resonated with me. Like getting lost and starting to panic, etc. And when you introduce an element of actual unexplained monsters into the scenario was actually quite terrifying (just got a bit of the shivers thinking about it).\n\nI am not surprised that The Blair Witch Project doesn&apos;t resonate well today, and especially with young audience smothered, by helicopter parents of today...and I know plenty of these parents now, lol. Man we used to get kicked out of the house, lol, and it was perfectly normal.\n\nSo, I still recommend this film to younger &quot;high-tech&quot; audience, because of this film&apos;s importance in cinema history, and if you happen to make it this far in my review. To be scared, you really have to keep in mind, the mindset of the people back in 1999. No cell phones, LED lights, no massive flood lights at every rural property, population density is less than by 35% than in 2024. And if you get hurt, like due to dehydration, or cut yourself, or just run out of gas, no one is coming for a long time. And when the help comes it will be from a complete stranger who sees your emergency lights. You step outside in almost compete darkness, and you hear a snort-wheeze from an angry mature buck for the first time, I promise you it sounds like some monster out of the movies...how would that make you feel?\n\nEnjoy!",

                "reviewBody": "This movie is campy, gory fun, amusing in parts, generally entertaining... and Jeffrey Combs is perfect as West--calm, creepy, and endearing at the same time. But at the same time, it lacks the beauty and eloquence of H.P. Lovecraft&apos;s original story, &quot;Herbert West--Re-Animator.&quot; The modern, 1980&apos;s setting seems odd and a bit awkward. West would be much more at home in the world around the nineteen-teens and twenties, when the original story was written and set.\n\nLovecraft&apos;s works are so much more than just shocking tales and monster stories. They&apos;re beautiful and engaging, thrilling and--not just gory, but genuinely morbid in the truest sense of the world; a sense that seems to have been largely lost in the world of modern horror.\n\nRe-Animator possesses none of the first three qualities. It does have some true morbidity--but only in the very small parts wherein it remains true to the source material.\n\nTo sum up: This is a good, entertaining movie, if you don&apos;t mind some gore. It&apos;s definitely worth watching. But it&apos;s the kind of movie you watch one night and then the next night forget about. It&apos;s far from worthy of cult classic status."

Now I suppose it pales in comparison to the better horror flicks I&apos;ve seen. It&apos;s still not a bad genre flick and I recommend seeing it. Children of the Corn has its moments. Isaac and Malachai are still creepy looking cats (both played effectively by John Franklin and Courtney Gains). The musical score with the children chanting is an eerie effect too. The caf\u00e9 scene and the accidental hit and run are the standouts of the movie, it&apos;s pretty grisly stuff. The rest is a bit mediocre. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are pretty good as the young couple trying to escape the murderous children. And an appearance by R.G. Armstrong is never a bad thing. The movie is a &quot;loose&quot; adaption of a Stephen King short story, but the sequels are just absolutely King rapes. So do not bother with those."

                "reviewBody": "&apos;The Last House On The Left&apos; is easily Wes Craven&apos;s most important movie. It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now, despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero&apos;s &apos;Night Of The Living Dead&apos; deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point (the late 60s), but even that had a supernatural element, something &apos;Last House On The Left&apos; eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence, most likely inspired by Peckinpah&apos;s &apos;Straw Dogs&apos; released the previous year, and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. &apos;Last House...&apos; is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal, so the movie is rough and crudely made at times, but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari&apos;s parents and the comic relief cops (who include Martin Kove later to appear in &apos;Death Race 2000&apos; and countless action movies!) are pretty awful, but the two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) are both very natural and believable, and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very, very good. Krug is played by David Hess, who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack, something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis&apos; &apos;All Shook Up&apos; and &apos;I Got Stung&apos; and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug&apos;s junkie son, Fred J. Lincoln (now a porno director I believe!) is excellent as the aptly named Weasel, and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie, who brings to mind some of Manson&apos;s girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. &apos;Last House On The Left&apos; is hardly the kind of movie you &quot;enjoy&quot; but I think it&apos;s a very important movie, and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It&apos;s really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend &apos;The Last House On The Left&apos; to anybody interested in the development of horror, screen violence, or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned, it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take. I think it is worth it as it&apos;s still an extraordinary piece of work!"

                "reviewBody": "Shaun of the Dead is quite a surprising and brilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status as word of mouth snowballs this film to richly deserved recognition.\n\nSimon Pegg, both the joint writer and the main star of the film, has been a comedic force for some time, most notably in the fantastic BBC2 series &apos;Hippies&apos; (which inexplicably bombed in the ratings) and the cult Channel 4 series &apos;Spaced&apos;.  Both programs hinted at Pegg&apos;s saliently dead pan comedic manner (and writing skills) which comes to full fruition in &apos;Shaun of the Dead&apos;.\n\nIn a nut shell, this film is a romantic comedy with zombies (or zom-rom-com) who appear for no good clear reason (although some tantalizing clues are offered).  The film is an amazing blend of the funny, the violent and the poignant.\n\nPegg has cast himself as one hell of a serious loser in this film.  And not in the &apos;American&apos; form of: &apos;I am a loser but I work in TV and have Jennifer Aniston as my wife&apos;  kind of loser as portrayed in tripe such as &apos;Bruce Almighty&apos; or dozens of other US &apos;loser&apos; films.  Pegg&apos;s Shaun is a genuine loser and extremely recognisable too, he&apos;s an everyday man who works for an electrical retailer and his life is just plain dull and disappointing - and this is where all the comedy comes from in this film.  There are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop.  The first time Shaun plods semi-comatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser.  However, by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on!  The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! Not that this film is subtle however, there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre. The funniest being a very subtle snipe at Boyles `28 days later&apos; - see if you can spot it!\n\nThe only problem with reviewing this film is that there are so many funny moments in it that it is hard to pick any to write about without spoiling the film.  All I can say is that I cannot remember a film ever being this consistently funny with probably five or six serious laugh-out-loud moments. It was a joy to watch and my only disappointment is that I can never watch this film for the first time ever again - every viewing will forever be a repeat viewing.\n\nShaun of the Dead is not very everyone though - the language from the beginning is strong and the violence was quite surprising for a 15 certificate film (in the UK). This film is definitely going to be most appreciated by horror fans who know a huge back catalogue of horror films. It will also be enjoyed by teenagers (who filled the cinema when I viewed this film which was terrific, as they laughed loudest).  Finally, I do have some criticism of this film and that is there is some wasted talent in the movie.  Black Book&apos;s (channel four) star Dylan Moran seemed a bit wasted and so was Martin Freeman (from BBC2&apos;s The Office) - who would have made a terrific zombie!  Also, did I spot Matt Lucas (from BBC3&apos;s &apos;Little Britain&apos;) in this film? I am not sure as I was laughing too hard maybe!\n\n These problems however are so minor and can easily be forgiven.  My suggestion is to go and slowly shuffle down to your local cinema to see this film and give Simon Pegg the money and recognition he deserves so that he can go on and make more films that are this good including what the UK papers have suggested as his next project - `From Dusk &apos;Till Shaun&apos;.",

                "reviewBody": "&quot;The Ghost &amp; the Darkness&quot; is a very good adventure flick set in Africa in the late 19th century, and is based on a true incident. Kilmer plays an engineer sent to build a railroad bridge over the Tsavo river. Work is halted by attacks from two man-eating lions which terrorize the workers. Seems these lions are exhibiting behavior not seen in lions before, i.e. they appear to be hunting for sport (&apos;the Ghost&apos; and &apos;the Darkness&apos; are the names given to the 2 lions by the native workers). Douglas plays a famous renegade American hunter, a tragically scarred Civil War veteran, hired by the railroad to kill the lions.\n\nGood adventure, well-paced, with stunning photography of the African countryside. The movie has an &quot;R&quot; rating which I can&apos;t figure out; perhaps because of the bloodiness of the lion dinner scenes (and lunch, and breakfast, and between-meal snacks....). I have seen many PG13&apos;s which have more blood &amp; guts than this.\n\nI give it a straight A; my 10-year old son gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up also).",

A great play on the serial killer theme, and hearing voices from God, which many real life killers claim to have experienced. With solid direction from the late Bill Paxton and great acting throughout. And for a more mainstream horror movie, it still packed some serious punches.\n\nSalut, Bill Paxton.",

                "reviewBody": "This classic low budget, black and white film is right up there with the best of the sci-fi/horror movies of the time. It appears that it was shot on a very low budget ($300,000), thus no special effects beyond the superimposed glowing eyes of the children and the burning house at the end (not much of an effect). But it became a real moneymaker and a cult developed around it. They went on to make a sequel which doesn&apos;t live up to the original.\n\nThe cast, though limited, is quite good. The ever sophisticated, urbane, George Sanders as the scientist; Barbara Shelley from Hammer films as his wife; and little Martin Stephens as David, putative offspring of Shelley and Sanders. This kid is evil personified and does a bang-up job for such a youngster.\n\nThe story involves the village of Midwich and the birth of 12 children fathered in a very strange way that is never totally explained, who are intellectual giants with one purpose.....take over the world. Should they be destroyed or studied?....that&apos;s the problem facing Sanders and the government. Sanders comes to the inevitable conclusion and because they can read his thoughts, he must think of a brick wall in order to mask his intent. The ending, although not surprising is still effective.\n\nThis film is a keeper and is recommended to all those who like their films straight to the point without all the special effects and computer generated action. It&apos;s minimal with maximum punch."

                "reviewBody": "A Classic! Spawning a whole new subgenre of vampire movies e.g. Vamp (Richard Wenk, 1986), Near Dark (Katheryn Bigelow, 1987), Bram Stoker&apos;s Dracula (Coppola. 1991) and Blade (Stephen Norrington, 1998), Fright Night is very similar to Count Yoga \u0096 Vampire, but is a brilliant film in its own right. If you can get past those eighties fashions and mannerisms this is a timeless treasure.\n\nCharlie Brewster (Ragsdale) is the student/horror film fanatic accusing his super-suave next door neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Sarandon) of being a bloodsucker. He begs cowardly, unemployed has-been horror veteran, Peter Vincent, \u0091The Great Vampire Killer&apos; (excellent performance by McDowell) to help him stake the Vampire. Cue lots of laughs, scares and some genuine unforgettable sequences. Fright Night predates the Scream trilogy by over a decade and does a much better job of combining the chills and jokes with tongue in cheek all the way. Like the homoerotic Interview with the Vampire (Neil Jordan, 1994), there&apos;s a subplot concerning Brewster loosing interest in his girlfriend and obsessing over the good looking man next door.\n\nBrad Fiedel (The Terminator &amp; Serpent and the Rainbow) and Tangerine Dream (Firestarter &amp; The Keep)&apos;s soundtrack here is also perfect and almost steals the show. Tom Holland, who had previously gained recognition and flashed his genre credentials for his screenplays for The Beast Within (Philippe Mora, 1982) and Psycho 2 (Richard Franklin, 1983), would go on to give us the charismatic killer doll, Chucky, in the original Child&apos;s Play movie, also starring Chris Sarandon.\n\nThe Fright Night sequel followed in 1987, but was too similar to its predecessor and lacked the intense, roller-coaster feeling. It&apos;s still worth seeing though, for McDowell and Ragsdale&apos;s return to the characters, I for one, will mostly remember them for. Stephen Geoffreys also deserves a mention for his OTT performance as Charlie&apos;s manic best friend, Evil Ed."

                "reviewBody": "\u0091The Wicker Man&apos; follows the story of Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) who travels to the Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. However, the entire population of the island, including the girl&apos;s own mother (Irene Summers), denies that such a girl ever existed and as the righteous Howie investigates further he learns the terrifying truth of Summerisle. \n\nFamed for an exceptional yet short performance from the legendary Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle, \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; is a textbook example of how to create a virtually seamless horror/thriller. Director Robin Hardy at one point thought this low-budget movie would never be made as he was forced to work with a very small budget, a short shooting schedule and a studio on the verge of bankruptcy that was in fact declared bankrupt just a few short months after filming was completed. However, \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; was made and nowadays is accepted as one of the finest horror/thrillers of all-time despite not receiving the praise it so deserved back in the Seventies. \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; was brilliantly written by Anthony Shaffer who chose to add very subtle clues as to what would happen that are made more apparent on further viewings. With the added advantage of obvious research into the pagan rituals \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; sought to portray the movie is left with a chilling feel of realism. \n\nAn enchanting soundtrack is blended marvellously into \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; which seems to lull the viewer into a false sense of security. Despite the constant foreboding feeling created by the intricate plot and top notch acting, there is a certain playful feeling that is brought about by the elegant soundtrack making it difficult to actually envisage any evil events occuring. One could be forgiven for wondering on a first viewing just where this bizarre little movie is going but the story has a quality about it that can grab the viewer and keep their interest all the way to the bitter and awfully haunting ending. The final scene as the credits roll is an image that is now engrained on my mind with all its emptiness and despair. As the curtain falls on this performance (so to speak) it becomes hard not to question the events leading up to the end and the humanity of these islanders. In some ways \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; is an unsettling history lesson that makes itself seem all too real. \n\nEdward Woodward gives a tremendous performance as the increasingly baffled Sgt. Howie. He played his character convincingly and Howie&apos;s eventual realisation of what is going on around him is portrayed so well that it adds more realism to the movie. Woodward was able to take a character that may be a figure of loathing in another type of horror movie and make the audience feel empathy towards him. The strong religious beliefs within Howie thoroughly clash with the free-loving pagan society which adds humour and distress at the same time. However, as mentioned before, Christopher Lee somehow stole the show playing the relatively small part of Lord Summerisle. His magnificent onscreen presence seems so powerful that one forgets that he is only in the movie for a short amount of time. Added to this great mix was Britt Ekland as Willow, the beautiful landlord&apos;s daughter. Her seductive, nude dance (though a double was apparently used in parts) was one of the most erotic moments in horror and helped to contribute further realism to the movie. The scenes featuring the clashing characters of Howie and Willow are both amusing and tense making for some interesting character interaction. \n\n\u0091The Wicker Man&apos; is undoubtedly a cult classic of the horror genre which I recommend to all fans of horror/thrillers. Visually pleasing with some superb acting and direction as well as a fine screenplay. My rating for \u0091The Wicker Man&apos; \u0096 9/10.",

                "reviewBody": "Perhaps I&apos;m a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it&apos;s located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.\n\nStill, judging 28 Days Later entirely on its merit as a film, it&apos;s easy to arrive at the conclusion that it&apos;s a fantastic achievement, as well as a coming-of-age of sorts for director Danny Boyle; I can&apos;t say the MTV-inspired vanity of The Beach, or the self-consciously trendy posturing of Trainspotting appealed to me, and to my shame I initially expected 28 Days Later to be given a similar treatment. Thankfully, my fears proved unfounded, discarded straight after a opening sequence which is at once effortless and fearsome. The rest of the movie was a joy. A terrifying joy, but a joy nonetheless.\n\nIt&apos;s true that sometimes minimalism can be more effective than overblown bravado, and it&apos;s definitely true for this movie. It&apos;s the scenes of complete silence which get to you the most; an entire metropolis empty. The grainy picture serves to add a documentary-style quality to the film, which makes the whole situation seem almost too real to bear. Definitely a wise choice to film this on digital video.\n\nYou will occasionally meet people who thought 28 Days Later wasn&apos;t &apos;scary&apos; or &apos;gory&apos; enough. These are the same people who will tell you that 2001 was &apos;boring&apos;, or that Memento was &apos;confusing&apos;. Ignore them. Others didn&apos;t understand the purpose of the second half, or were confused by its change of pace, feeling that it distracted from the movie as a whole. However, I personally regard the second half as very important because, as another reviewer pointed out, it makes a very succinct point: What is scarier, the end of the world, or having the world repopulated by maniacs? That, I think, is where the real Horror of 28 Days Later lies.\n\n28 Days Later, like the Romero zombie flicks of yore, is ultimately an allegory of the days we are living in, an age in which we are constantly confronted with violence by the media (much like the ape right at the start of the film), where violence begets violence, and humanity faces an uncertain future. I applaud Danny Boyle&apos;s bravery in making 28 Days Later because he undoubtedly took a big commercial risk when the majority of the cinema-going public might prefer escapism to words of caution. Remember, Rage is a human-made disease. Quite the allegory there.\n\nLike most great masterpieces of their time, 28 Days Later has been misunderstood by a considerable amount of people. I have no doubt it will go down in history as a classic, the one movie which perfectly sums up the confused era we are living in. And even if you didn&apos;t like it, it would be advisable to give 28 Days Later another chance; it&apos;s a haunting experience when looked at from the right angle. Danny Boyle has many years left in him, I hope he&apos;ll continue making more movies like this.",

While this movie is graphic, the conflicting tones of horror and comedy give it a playfulness and a freshness that any true movie-lover could appreciate. Now, its not by any means the best movie ever or the funniest or most horrific but it shines its light. The story and characters are all cheesy/campy but thats what gives this movie its charm. Its almost like whats going on is so absurd and awful and awkward you have no choice but to laugh! I don&apos;t recommend this film to the faint of heart but if you are in the mood for something new and will keep you talking for weeks, then I say this is the film for you. If anything, just to say you saw it is quite enough for most people. Women, you&apos;ll appreciate it more than you think. Men, you&apos;ll be more careful out there in the real world.",

Why does the monster have to be on-screen to make it good?  Hitchcock said that suspense plays better than action and although this film missed many opportunities to be more suspenseful, it&apos;s is at least not stupid.\n\nIn how many horror films today does the hero know the monster and its nature when he should?  Steve knows what he&apos;s dealing with almost from the beginning and his frustration is not being able to convince the authorities.\n\n Yet the authorities act in a totally credible way as well, even the annoying sergeant.  Who would believe such a story from a bunch of &quot;kids&quot; (we know Steve wasn&apos;t a kid, but his character is).\n\nOne key example of the movie&apos;s intelligence: Steve is yelling to Dave to get CO2 fire extinguishers long after Dave has already gotten the message and dispatched people to get them.  How many movies made in the 90s would be smart about this subtle detail?\n\nI&apos;m really tired of watching movies and having people behave in ways different than they really would in real life (the most irritating recent example is Tom Hanks falling asleep with the flashlight on in Cast Away). Horror films in particular do this in spades (which is why the Scream films have been so popular), but The Blob, to me, stayed pretty true to its characters, and in so doing made a smarter and better film.\n\nYes there are many flaws, perhaps biggest is Steve McQueen&apos;s very uneven performance, but I think they missed key opportunities for suspense that could have turned this above average, kinda scary, kinda funny movie that&apos;s a cult favourite into a true classic."

After listening to all the hype, and following this film until 2007 you could say I knew a lot about this little film. Nothing could prepare me for the climatic, scary ass situations that the cast and crew put on celluloid. Yes, my friends, it really is a scary movie. \n\nI won&apos;t tell you what it&apos;s about because by this point you should already know that. What I want to tell you is how great this film really is. \n\nDirector Peli has succeeded in creating a masterpiece with little money and simple theme park haunted house gags. He does something that Hitchcock did so well in his prime-he creates a level of suspense so intense that the smallest sound makes your heart jump. \n\nThat, is great film-making, because it is made with an educated audience in mind. He doesn&apos;t cater to the general public he gives film lovers what they want and he gives it to them hard. \n\nDon&apos;t go to this for gore. Don&apos;t go to this for Hollywood crap. Don&apos;t go to this with your kids under 15. Most importantly....don&apos;t go to this...alone.",

                "reviewBody": "These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino&apos;s violent and hollow &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I&apos;m not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative &quot;the Last Samurai&quot; (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: &quot;Ringu&quot; (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he&apos;s an uneven director. &quot;Mousehunt&quot; (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but &quot;the Mexican&quot; (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: &quot;don&apos;t watch &quot;the Ring&quot;, it&apos;s a hokey movie&quot;. I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven&apos;t seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.\n\nThe starting point promises great things and Verbinski will deliver them throughout his flick. The main character, Rachel wants to investigate about a mysterious and cursed videotape which causes the death of the viewer seven days after the latter watched it. What do these outlandish and eerie images mean? What lies beneath them? At her own risk, she and her son watch the video. She has one week to find out the meaning and the omen of the video. &quot;The Ring&quot; could well illustrate this famous premise: &quot;to understand evil, we&apos;ve got to go back to the sources...&quot;.\n\nWhat distinguishes &quot;the Ring&quot; from other horror stuff of these last years is that there&apos;s a solid scenario which holds water until the very last minutes of Rachel&apos;s adventure and shelves quite an important number of formulaic ingredients. Special effects which have seemed to become the backbone for many horror flicks are used only when necessary and without flashy effects. Still better, Verbinski shows respect for the audience by clarifying as much as possible obscure points of the story. On an unhurried pace, Verbinski takes all his time to film Rachel&apos;s investigation. His directing is also worth the price of admission. It is well-crafted and set with clockwork precision for the schedule of spooky moments. Besides, what is notable in &quot;the Ring&quot; is that Verbinski delays as much as possible chilling sequences to better play with the viewer&apos;s nerves. This entails an unsettling aura which helps to convey a latent tension. Lighting and makeup shouldn&apos;t also be forgotten.\n\nThe thrust of &quot;the Ring&quot; isn&apos;t only to entertain and to make shiver. It is also doubled by a reflexion on the power of the image. One of the images of the film depicts a woman in front of a mirror looking at the camera. So, she&apos;s also looking at the viewer. This is unhealthy voyeurism that the movie denounces like the insensible media which expose to the mainstream, woes and sorrows of the victims and so manipulate the viewers&apos; fears. The sequence during which Ann Morgan&apos;s husband is incensed by Rachel&apos;s will to learn more about Samara rings thoroughly true. Moreover, these seemingly maladjusted images embody symbols: the chair and the lighthouse illustrate loneliness, the figure at the window (a hint at &quot;Psycho&quot;?, 1960) might symbolize parental severity.\n\nThat said, Verbinski&apos;s genteel piece of work isn&apos;t exempted of drawbacks. Rachel&apos;s little boy is a cardboard character, a vague cousin of Haley Joel Osment in &quot;the Sixth Sense&quot; (1999). When Samara gets out of the well and the screen to kill Rachel&apos;s companion, it&apos;s nearly Punch and Judy and the first sequence with the two female students in their twenties something, all alone in a house in which strange phenomena and false alarms occur... well, you get the picture. But they&apos;re minor quibble and don&apos;t overflow too much on the thrill of the vision.\n\nI repeat it: I haven&apos;t seen the Japanese ambassador but when a remake is able both to scare with reserve, without flashy special effects and to make the viewer think about what he watches, it can be gratifying. And in the case of &quot;the Ring&quot;, rightly so...\n\nA sequel &quot;the Ring 2&quot; opened last year. Is it worthwhile?",

Its really much more than that. This is definitely one of the better horror films to come along these days.\n\nMy audience loved it, and so did I.",

Loud, obnoxious, dumb, phony, idiotic. I hated all but the quieter one immediately and thoroughly.\n\nI&apos;ve wised up over the years, and don&apos;t give a bad movie much slack anymore. Inevitably, my guts are right, and they never get better, despite a pack or morons having rated it highly enough to encourage me to take a gander. So I quit it, and took a closer look at the poor comments here at IMDb, which I should have done before watching it.\n\nHow it garnered an average score of 7.3 is beyond me. But then, people eat trash all the time and call it good..\n\nIt sucks. It&apos;s amateurish, lame, and pointless. Save your precious time."

The movie has excessive use of dramatics. The soundtrack, colored lighting and the use of gore is prominent throughout. The cinematography, use of imbibition colors makes this movie *eye-catching*\n\nThe Bad - Color is the only praise worthy aspect of this movie. Although the movie lays emphasis on gore and is intriguing till the end, the plot is fairly laid out and the acting falls weak. I would simply call this film an art movie which experiments with Horror.\n\nStill, Suspiria has a legacy which topples the movies of the current era. It is definitely in my list of must-watch movies!",

                "reviewBody": "When I was about 13 years-old, I tried to rent this on VHS several times. Unfortunately, my mother kept walking in during a particularly violent segment and made me turn it off. It was a long time before I finally saw the whole film.\n\nIf you watch the accompanying Just Desserts documentary on the double-disc DVD, you&apos;ll see how lovingly crafted this film really was. Not only so, but this truly transcends the schlock horror of its E.C. origins. The acting is first rate and the plots surprisingly thoughtful, considering how short each segment is. For example, watch Aunt Bedelia&apos;s tortured graveside monologue in Father&apos;s Day, or the curious interplay between Henry and Dex in The Crate. E.G. Marshall totally nails it in They&apos;re Creeping Up On You, the segment most loaded with subtext.\n\nTom Savini&apos;s make-up effects are excellent and he doesn&apos;t scrimp on the gore. The one segment I dislike is Something To Tide You Over, as it&apos;s a particularly nasty and sadistic story (despite the just desserts moral).\n\nOverall, this has a worthy place in the annals of 80s horror and will always hold fond memories for me; a young boy who just wanted to see that crate monster tear his victims apart like sour bread.",

                "reviewBody": "I just was exiting the theater after seeing &apos;9&apos;, which is also worth a look, when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland, which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture, but I&apos;d say this exceeded my expectations, which isn&apos;t to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn&apos;t really overstay it&apos;s welcome. \n\nAs you might expect for this genre, it&apos;s quite gory, so don&apos;t go expecting a light &apos;R&apos; rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there&apos;s some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI&apos;m certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn&apos;t as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I&apos;m sure it does make a difference that I saw &apos;Shaun&apos; alone on DVD, while &apos;Zombieland&apos; I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet&apos;s face it, you know what&apos;s going to happen in this flick, but I&apos;m happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you&apos;re getting into I doubt you&apos;ll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven&apos;t made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, &apos;Zombieland&apos; does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.",

                "reviewBody": "I was pretty disappointed. It&apos;s more of a step down than a step up for Cronenberg; it seemed like he was sacrificing his vision to make a mainstream-friendly film. As a result, the film is basically a bunch of great scenes strung along by a generic, rather lame plot and some truly terrible performances. Even so, those scenes - the exploding head, the phone line stuff, the final battle - are so fantastic and so memorable in their own right that they make it worth getting through everything that comes between. Just a brilliant combination of sound and image in those sequences. So, overall, the film is nothing great, but it&apos;s not a complete wreck, either.",

Scientists of course find the opportunity way too tempting and before you can say &quot;Told you that was a dumb move!&quot; we have a genetically engineered, rather stunning young blonde walking around the lab, causing all sorts of political and scientific unrest.....sound familiar? \n\n Yep, SPECIES was a total conceptual rip-off and to my knowledge, either no-one has ever noticed the fact OR has failed to put such view into print. Certainly not a solitary film critic worldwide that I read at the time was aware of the fact! That said, SPECIES wasn&apos;t a total flopperoo although Ben Kingsley looked majorly uncomfortable, if not stunned for the greater part of the flick, as the head science honcho really wanting his creation (the delectable and statuesque Miss Henstridge) dead on sight....a task he bequeathes to Mr Madsen who always enjoys work of this sort!\n\nNever really scales the heights. Neither a major gore-fest or a jaw-dropping ALIEN-wannabe. It labors on beneath its own mediocrity and when it finally finishes, about the only emotion left to the viewer is..&quot;Hmmmmm, OK, now I&apos;ve seen SPECIES....what&apos;s for dinner?&quot;  Compared to its sequel however, it remains a rare masterpiece!"

Oh course while I watched it, I had no dreams of Gremlins and never connected the two.\n\nIn reality, I guess Critters are Gremlins without the Gizmos, but then again Gremlins without Gizmos are just plain mean.\n\nand Critters are just mean....\n\nThey kill with no reason, they eat like there is no tomorrow, and even the Church cannot save the poor town&apos;s cattle.\n\nAs far as a classic, this is not, but it and Tremors are up there with the most immaginative and creative horror movies of the past few decades.",

It almost feels like it was written by a teenager. The ending is especially frustrating. The movie tries to throw everything at the wall and nothing sticks. The deer flailing through the windshield was just cringe. The whole final chase was awkward and abrupt. To me, its more proof that Roth movies offer nothing more than gross out horror. The special effects makeup was pretty amazing. Especially considering the buget and when it was made. There are moments in this movie that were effective. The bathtub scene was tense. As was the first run in with patient zero. Unfortunately that doesnt do much to save this mess of a horror.",

                "reviewBody": "When it comes to silly movies, they don&apos;t get much sillier than this one. The title says it all, and its clear going into a movie called &apos;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&apos; that you&apos;re not exactly going to be in for a serious ride. To be honest, I can&apos;t say I was overly enthused with this Sci-Fi spoof, but it&apos;s not hard to see why it&apos;s got a cult following. The film takes in the idea of clowns being eerie and frightening, and fuses it with the common theme of aliens coming down from space; thus giving us aliens that look like clowns. For what it is, the film is actually quite inventive; and while much of the action is clich\u00e9d and/or samey, it&apos;s the little things that ensure it doesn&apos;t get boring. As mentioned, the plot follows aliens from space that look like clowns. When their spaceship (a tent) lands in the forest, two kids rush to the police headquarters to tell the law that their town is being invaded. If someone gave me that story, I&apos;d definitely believe it; but the law in this town is slightly more sceptical, and while the kids aren&apos;t being believed; the clown population is growing.\n\nOne thing I do like about this movie is the special effects. Rather than simply having the clowns being played by men in make-up and baggy clothes, director Stephen Chiodo has opted to make actual suits for the villains. The special effects are a lot like those seen in Tim Burton&apos;s Beetlejuice in the same year, and bode well with this absurd plot line. The style of the movie is consistently clown themed, and parts of the film such as the climax on the alien spaceship look great. The acting is typical B-movie, but the movie does benefit from several good performers. The young cast perform well enough with energetic performances that, like the rest of the movie, aren&apos;t delivered too seriously; but the standout is veteran actor John Vernon, who is great in the role of the sceptic police officer. The &apos;horror&apos; in this movie is hardly potent, as much of it is sapped out because of the fact that it&apos;s all a big joke - but ideas such as people being cocooned in candy floss or eaten up by a shadow puppet are surreally frightening. Overall, this isn&apos;t a favourite of mine; but it offers ninety minutes of good fun and there&apos;s no real reason to hate it.",

                "reviewBody": "The Uninvited has been right at the top of my must see list for years now and any film with that amount of build up is liable to disappoint; but that is not the case with this film, as The Uninvited really lives up to it&apos;s billing as one of the best ghost stories ever committed to celluloid! The film works because it is not over reliant on any one element of it; there&apos;s enough human drama to be interesting but not overbearing while the story is important but doesn&apos;t get in the way of the drama and this is all wrapped up in a thoroughly foreboding atmosphere. The plot focuses on an old house by a cliff side. Brother and sister(!) Roderick and Pamela Fitzgerald take one look at the house and fall in love with it instantly and after speaking with the house owner, a Commander Beech, agree a price to buy the house. The deal is initially unwelcome by the Commander&apos;s granddaughter Stella as it was once her mother&apos;s house, who died when she was three years old. However, she soon starts up a friendship with the brother and it&apos;s not long before they realise that something is not quite right with the house.\n\nThe film is directed by Lewis Allen and he does a really good job with it. Much of the film takes place at night and this allows him to deliver a thoroughly chilling atmosphere and the way that the house is soaked in shadows is creepy in the extreme. The characters walk around with only candles to light the way and this fits in very well with the blood curdling screams of the unseen phantoms! The film stars the great Ray Milland, and he delivers a great performance; owning the screen with a charismatic swagger and helping to keep things interesting. The film also stars the beautiful Gail Russell as the love interest. The ghost plot almost takes a backseat at times to the developing love story between Milland and Russell&apos;s characters, but this is not a problem since the film always remains intriguing. The ghost story is not particularly complex but it has more than enough about it to carry along the film and the atmosphere. It all boils down to a suitable ending and overall this really is a brilliant little ghost story and one that should be a must see for all horror fans!",

                "reviewBody": "This movies takes a different approach to what makes Michael Myers terrifying. In the past his inhuman mas murders were shocking because of the absolute lack of emotion and more machine like manner in which things occur. Zombie offers audiences a background on myers. Where before the terror came in the lack of explanation, Zombie creates terror by showing how empty and how reasonless he was at 10 years old.\n\nAn interesting note about the movie is after Michael at 10 you never see his face. This part may not be different from standard Halloween movies, but unlike those, in this film you have already seen Michael&apos;s face as a boy. This then leaves the audience placing the boys face beneath the mask of the 30 year old monster making the idea of these overly brutal killings more difficult to chalk up to another death in a slasher flick. The movie gives less focus to Lori Strode and much more focus on Michael and his progressions from 10 to 30.\n\nZombie makes the smart call of not completely taking his own new plot line, but also not creating an exact carbon copy, leaving in specific scenes and details but still skipping over some of the more memorable ones. No, it is not John Carpenter&apos;s movie remastered, but then if you want that just run it through some filters to make his movie look new. Instead, this movie feels like a Zombie movie but in all the right ways. Best Halloween in a very long time.",

                "reviewBody": "I wasn&apos;t sure about this one, I cannot remember anything about Flight of the Concords (sp?) and comedy is a sticky thing for me. I find that I laugh out loud more often during dramas, horror, thrillers etc than comedies. I thought GRAND BUDAPEST, ZERO THEOREM and THE DOUBLE were hilarious. But this surprised me... a lot.\n\nBlade, Twilight, Werewolves, Zombies, they all make an appearance. The plot is actually quite funny in itself... it isn&apos;t meaty by any means, but it is also a joke: as the documentary team follows three vampires &apos;flatting&apos; together: one who is very... camp, shall we say, another who is self-described as being hot... because he is a vampire, of course, and another who seems like a satirical-take on your stereotypical long-hair/metal-head. Oh, and an 8,000 year old friend who doesn&apos;t seem to possess the skills of communication.\n\nThey begin to talk the crew through how they try to socialise, which leads to some amusing scenes of vampires trying to have a nightlife. Then they talk the crew through how they capture/seduce people in order to drink their blood. More funny scenes follow, leading to one of these victims escaping from the flat. Of course he doesn&apos;t die, he becomes the new vamp in the gang. But.. He&apos;s young, he&apos;s stupid, he is not even over a hundred years old! When he introduces his human friend to his vampire friends, you just know its not gonna go well. I won&apos;t go any further, but from here the plot delves the movie into comedic chaos. I was missing jokes because I was laughing at the ones previous! There are no immature fart jokes here, there aren&apos;t any jokes that make you cringe in their lame delivery.... Even though they are throwing a lot of crud at the wall, most of it sticks. It is also filled with comedic variety. Physical humour, plain old slapstick, facial expressions/body language (especially that camp vampire who always leads the doco crew around, his facial expressions and eye-movements when following the cameras cracked me up every time), and obviously sarcasm and satire are underlying themes.\n\nThis thing felt that it was running on all cylinders for the entire movie. It also manages to feel effortless; there was no sense of them trying too hard for laughs - the mockumentary setting helped the film in this sense, despite the plot being thin. But, the wide range of comedy used, from slapstick to satire and everything in between, is probably the biggest reason why this movie does not feel forced.\n\nI walked out of this movie in pain from laughter. After only 87 minutes! The entire place was in stitches for the entire movie, and I saw people from all ages as I walked out, all with giant grins, talking about this or that scene. I&apos;m chuckling as I am writing this as its stimulating my memory and I am seeing it in my head.\n\nwww.epilepticmoondancer.net",

                "name": "Very gruesome and claustrophobic zombie movie.",
                "reviewBody": "In 1985 this zombie movie virtually went by unnoticed except for many Romero fans. It was virtually dead a week or two after it hit the theaters. Many attribute its failings to the other many horror films released that year including &quot;Re-Animator&quot;, &quot;Fright Night&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot;. All these movies were R though and day was not. Romero stuck to his guns and made a very gory movie. Unfortunately, when dawn was released there were still many independent theaters, but by 1985 the chains had taken over and one thing chains do is not show movies like this. So it went by unnoticed and those that did notice it usually had nothing good to say about it other than the zombies looked really good. So suffice to say, I wasn&apos;t expecting much when I bought this movie except the zombies would look good. However, I am happy to report that I was very pleasantly surprised. Granted, Dawn was still a better film as it had more likable characters than the ones featured in this film. This would be the final Dead film George Romero would do until Land of the Dead was released, but I do not count that one as part of his original trilogy as they seem to belong together because Night showed us the humble beginnings of the zombie outbreak, Dawn showed us the zombies beginning to overrun us and this film shows us a bleak world where the zombies now outnumber the living 400,000 to one. \n\nThe story has a group at the beginning flying a helicopter in the hopes of finding some survivors. All they find is the dead and quite frankly, any survivors out there would be better off keeping their mouth shut as they do not want to go back to the facility this group belongs to. It is like a bunker and in it we have scientists who have no clue what they are doing, army people in a rush to leave said facility even though there is no indication there are any people left, two civilian guys just doing their jobs and Bub the most awesome zombie ever! Tensions are running high in the facility as the army people want to leave and there is a lot of arguing; however, things take a turn for the even worse and the zombies that are topside begin to lick their lips! \n\nThis film has great looking zombies and it does a good job with its setting. Originally, George wanted to do something much larger in scope, but could not get the funding so he had to scale back immensely which is why we sadly on get the one shot topside in the city and get to see how much the zombies have taken over. Everything in this film is rather good, except the characters! Seriously, Bub who is a zombie is the most likable character and then civilian guys. Everyone else just wants to yell and rant and this film is not a good one to watch when you have a headache! The good news is that this creates a finale where you really want to see a few of these guys eaten and suffer, unlike Dawn where you just kind of get a random motorcycle gang out of nowhere. \n\nSo this film is good, just not as good as Dawn as this one just does not have the action of that film and for a good portion of the film the only thing you have to look forward too in between the shouting matches between the scientists and evil Bono are the Bub scenes. It does help build up the finale and like I said, you really want to watch these guys get eaten, but it also tends to get annoying as no one really seems right. That is just the way it goes though, mankind is pretty much lost here and so why worry about trying to cure something that cannot be cured when you can just try and live out your life the best you can.",

Perhaps there&apos;s links with those who seek to take control, those who manipulate, without going to polls, whose dogma and conviction, imposition and infliction, makes dystopia, a realistic goal.\n\nReflective and engaging, at many levels.",

                "reviewBody": "Hitchcock did one hell of a job!  I was planning on watching this movie just for about 30 minutes before going to sleep and was gonna finish watching it the next day, but instead I was so engaged that I couldn&apos;t stop watching and stayed awake the whole 2 hours.  I loved the irony of the actual rapist having no clues pointing to him and the innocent man having all clues pointing to him.  The scene involving the rapist in the back of the truck, rummaging through a sack of potatoes (and that&apos;s all I&apos;ll reveal) is classic suspense.  I also loved how Hitchcock left the rape scenes (excluding the first one) up to the imagination.  There is a great shot where one of the victims is being raped and we don&apos;t even hear any off-screen yells or screams.  The camera simply tracks backwards down a staircase and out the front door, where people walk by minding their own business, ignorant to the evil that&apos;s being committed a floor above.  Any amateurish director would&apos;ve went for true shock value and showed all the rape scenes in explicit detail. We don&apos;t call Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.  The scene is still quite haunting.  In horror and suspense, what you don&apos;t see can be a lot more frightening than what you do see, since the imagination is a powerful thing.  The last line of the movie should go down in history.  It had me bawling with laughter!  Just that one line gave perfect closure to this wonderful film.    \n\nMy score:  8 (out of 10)",

Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, &apos;Get Out&apos; is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.\n\nIt&apos;s an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread. \n\nThat the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It&apos;s nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film&apos;s combative themes. \n\nBeing somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. &apos;Get Out&apos; benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though &apos;The Shape of Water&apos; and especially &apos;Lady Bird&apos; were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. \n\nDespite how it sounds, &apos;Get Out&apos; struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. \n\nWhile all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya&apos;s superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. \n\nMy only complaint of &apos;Get Out&apos; is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that&apos;s it note. \n\nUntil then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it&apos;s a great film that is among the year&apos;s better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It is up there with &quot;Sinister&quot; as one of the scariest films I have watched. Since it&apos;s based off of &quot;true events&quot;, it makes it even more interesting. I can&apos;t quite give it a full 10 star rating because it does have quite a few jump scares, but at least a good portion of those jump scares add to the atmosphere of this movie. If you are a first time watcher of this movie, it will certainly disturb you for a while. It doesn&apos;t stick with me like &quot;Sinister&quot; does long after, but The Conjuring is a fun watch and I always love coming back for a rewatch every now and then."

                "reviewBody": "Five persons are visiting a catacomb following a guide and get lost. They find that they are trapped in a crypt and, out of the blue, they see The Crypt Keeper (Ralph Richardson) that tells five stories: (1) And All through the House: On the Christmas Eve, Joanne Clayton (Joan Collins) kills her husband expecting to receive his insurance. She hears on the news that the police are seeking-out a serial-killer posing of Santa Claus. When the man knocks on her door, she cannot call the police since the body of her husband lays on the living room, and Joanne locks windows and doors. When she looks for her daughter, she has a lethal surprise. (2) Reflection of Death: Carl Maitland (Ian Hendry) leaves his wife and children and leaves town with his mistress. However something happens during their journey (3) Poetic Justice: The widower janitor Arthur Edward Grimsdyke (Peter Cushing) is a good man that spends his leisure time with the children from the neighborhood. His heartless neighbor James Elliot (Robin Phillips) does not like him and destroys his life leading Grimsdyke to the suicide on the Valentine Day. One year later, Grimsdyke rises from his tomb seeking revenge against James. (4) Wish you Were Here: The dirty businessman Ralph Jason (Richard Greene) is bankrupted and his lawyer and friend Charles Gregory (Roy Dotrice) tells him that he must sell his real estate. When he tells to his wife Enid (Barbara Murray), she recalls that they have a statue with the legend that it could grant three wishes to the owner. She makes the wishes with tragic consequences to Ralph. (5) Blind Alleys: The cruel Major William Rogers (Nigel Patrick) comes to the Elmridge Home for the Blind with his dog Shane to be the new director. He is very cruel with the interns until the day that they revenge the bad treatment. Soon the five persons discover that they are at the gate of hell.\n\nIn 1972, I was a teenager and I saw this &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; in the movie theater. I was very impressed with the tale &quot;Wish you Were Here&quot; but I did not know the name of the movie. A couple of days ago, two friends of mine gave me the chance to see this movie again and I would like to thank them.\n\n&quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; is divided in five segments: (1) &quot;And All through the House&quot; is very creepy and has an ironic conclusion. (8/10) (2) &quot;Reflection of Death&quot; is the weakest segment with a deceptive story. (4/10) (3) &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; is a grim and heartbreaking segment. (9/10) (4) &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is an impressive segment. Ralph embalmed and burning for the eternity is unforgettable. (10/10) (5) &quot;Blind Alleys&quot; is another sinister episode and the revenge of the blind interns is scary. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Contos do Al\u00e9m&quot; (&quot;Tales from Beyond&quot;)\n\nNote: On 14 November 2013, I saw this movie again.\n\nNote: On 16 July 2019, I saw this film again.",

It&apos;s a well acted, believable account of a mum and child being haunted by a seemingly malevolent &apos;thing&apos;. Effective jumps and creeping tension are handled well.\n\nBut I was surprised again by the end, as I came away seeing it as an allegory for deep grief and a way through it. I found it quite moving, the mum finding a place for that darkness, finally taking control of it.",

This time, it&apos;s the undead Egyptian priest, I&apos;m-ho-tep (Boris Karloff), who puts the beautiful Helen under his spell. David Manners and Edward Van Sloan both reprise their Dracula roles as the young hero, and the wise old mentor respectively. Van Sloan, who is the only actor to appear in Frankenstein, Dracula and The Mummy, gives his best performance here. Karloff is also quite good as the evil villain, I&apos;m-ho-tep. This remains the only mummy movie that can really be called a suspense film or thriller rather than a monster movie. It&apos;s not quite as good as Frankenstein, but it&apos;s still one of the better classic horror flicks.",

It entertained me, and it had zombie-like people (well, it was actually a virus, like in 28 days/weeks later- but still, that concept of zombies is always awesome). The camera was pretty shaky at times, which was a bit much, and at the end, Jennifer Carpenter, as hot as she is, got pretty annoying with the screams, crying, and hyperventilating. Kind of wish she would have shut up near the end.\n\nPretty good jumps, some decent little gore parts- so overall, not a bad movie. I would probably buy it on DVD. Obviously no movie is perfect, and everyone will have their own views, likes, and dislikes. If you look at all the other past horror movies, this one isn&apos;t too shabby. Look, a movie entertains you, then it did it&apos;s job. That&apos;s why it&apos;s called &quot;entertainment.&quot; Just because some jackass on the street says it sucks, and just because it didn&apos;t get many &quot;stars,&quot; doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s a bad movie. Plenty of &quot;bad movies&quot; have entertained the hell out of me- in turn, making them good movies- to me, at least.",

                "reviewBody": "There&apos;s no way for me to talk about this film without making it personal. I can recall the age of eight, wandering around the square desert of my parents&apos; backyard, action figures in hand, thinking up stories, doing voices. Tideland plays to that sort of nostalgia, but it balances it with a darkness visible on the horizon that cancels out whatever baser desires such nostalgia plays to. I imagine when I see the film&apos;s landscape (and the house)how wonderful the setting would have been to that sort of play, how much such play could benefit from that setting, and how lost one could get in it all. Permanently lost. The fields transforming into a sea is a great metaphor for that.\n\nTideland is a tragedy. We, the audience, know or suspect that Jeliza-Rose isn&apos;t going to turn out well after this movie&apos;s over, that her imagination may be keeping her alive and marginally sane, but it&apos;s out of desperation (and it&apos;s clear that she understands much more of what&apos;s going on than is explicitly stated - observe her knowing looks, as in the scene where Dickens leaves her alone), that the little girl is going through so much for relatively little. In a way this film is about what many viewers incorrectly believe Gilliam&apos;s Brazil to be about: the triumph of the imagination. But, if anything, in Brazil Sam Lowry&apos;s imagination is what causes the trouble to begin with, and in the end is his last resort. In Tideland, imagination is defeated. In the end it&apos;s like one of those horror films where the heroine survives all, only to be shown walking away with the monster/killer still behind her/in her house/in the backseat of the car/etc. But there&apos;s an emotional resonance here that can&apos;t be found in, say, Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street because Jeliza-Rose has no literal fate, has no death but life. She returns to the real world. And I suppose that&apos;s the tragedy.\n\nThis is Gilliam&apos;s most complete film since Brazil; it has an emotional quality, an imaginative quality, and a GENUINE quality that no other Gilliam film has, and which few other films, period, have these days (cinema as it is now being so choked with irony). With Brazil we may be tempted to cry at the end if we are quick to tears, but with Tideland we may be tempted to develop tears anywhere. It reminds me of Forbidden Games, of Spirit of the Beehive, of Truffaut&apos;s Small Change, of Renoir&apos;s The River, of The Wizard of Oz, of Curse of the Cat People, and in some ways of Ford&apos;s How Green Was My Valley. It has pedigree.\n\nFerland&apos;s performance is nothing short of supernatural. She carries the film when it wanders or when it becomes flat out strange. She is that human voice in the wilderness.\n\nNot that there aren&apos;t some problems. The accents are fairly ridiculous all of the time and all the supporting characters are Gothic caricatures with performances to match, but then this is a child&apos;s world and a child&apos;s field of vision, and so I can accept these. The point is that reality doesn&apos;t much enter into it. There isn&apos;t much plot to speak of and this turns up in a few draggy sections. But this film has an absorbing quality too, and I find that if I turn it on I am compelled to watch all of it.\n\nI keep thinking of Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, which was so critically lauded while Tideland was so despised. PL&apos;s an okay movie, but it&apos;s a cynical adult tale of childhood, detached in its understanding and sort of heartless and cruel. The problem is that there is such an obvious disconnect between reality and the imaginary world. They exist separately. Of course, the Spanish Civil War setting is really no more real that Ofelia&apos;s own world, no less cartoonish than the world of Tideland. But it tries so hard to be harsh and gritty. It is just so difficult for me to *buy* Pan&apos;s Labyrinth, to take it seriously OR to NOT take it seriously. Tideland is a story about a real person living in a believable (or at least buyable)world. And I suspect that this is why Pan&apos;s Labyrinth is so critically lauded while Tideland is so critically despised - because it is unwilling to offend. Also, where PL is unfathomably ugly, Tideland is quite beautiful.\n\nOverall, this may the only film of last year I can honestly say I liked, that made me feel anything for it. So it&apos;s good.",

                "reviewBody": "Ed Harley lives with his young son in the country, where they live a simple life and run a small store. Some city teens stop by at the store and get on their bikes for some fun. While this is happening Ed leaves his son to look after the shop as he delivers a item to a customer. When Ed arrives back he finds out his boy has been accidentally killed by one the careless riders. In fist of anger he seeks out an old lady who can summon up a demon which shall exact revenge on those involved in the death of his son. However, Ed starts to realise it was a bad idea and he eventually finds out that conjuring up this demon comes at a price. \n\nOh hail, B-legend Lance Henriksen! It&apos;s Henriksen&apos;s burning conviction and special effects whiz Stan Winston&apos;s masterful monster design that lifts this B-grade monster feature out of the very ordinary mould. I can see why those factors get highly praised. Pretty much it&apos;s typical 80s horror fodder, but on that point I found this minor piece be an enthralling backwoods shocker that&apos;s effectively creepy and ominous in its set-up. The atmospheric air just has that feel of the old style monster flicks. I found it to be a vivid treasure in that department with the empty woodlands being so chillingly, foreboding in presence. The dread of it all just swallows you up! Especially the glum conclusion. The night scenes are sensationally staged with very classy touches with the moon&apos;s rays shinning through, swirling mists and the shades of blues flood the screen with great impact. Director Stan Winston (making his debut) utilizes the scenery with skillful execution by giving the film such an organic feel and producing some blinding images within some eerie and thrilling set-pieces (the transformation scene being one). Chiming in also is that of the score which creaks an unsteady terror with it&apos;s alienating chords. I thought the dark feel and slick look of the film is perfect and that&apos;s rightfully so. \n\nThough, it&apos;s not without its flaws. The main one being the scratchy writing with it being riddled with clich\u00e9s, loose characters and repetition. The premise and feeble script could have done with a polish up, because the urban legend of this rural demon does make for an interesting viewing. Thrown up in the story are some thoughtful questions and a emotional edge, but still it was kinda lacking. The stock characters are reasonably an unlikeable bunch, but thank goodness Lance Henriksen gives out a powerful and hypnotic performance that you totally feel his hurt. While, the rest of the cast were modest even if their characters are vague as can be and had very little to work with. Now the other star of the film was the magnificent, but horrific looking demon that&apos;s simply grand in stature and hands out punishment with such ease by toying around with it&apos;s victims in such a cruel manner. Death scenes might be brutal, but if you want some gore out of those moments\u0085 there is some bad news. There ain&apos;t any. Some blood, but no gore. But if you&apos;re looking for some suspense leading up to the kills it seems to mishandle those moments by being very foreseeable. Pacing wise the film is solid even though after the intense beginning it seems to stall for a while, well that&apos;s until Pumpkinhead reappears and things really do get going with it&apos;s quest for relentless horror. \n\nA solid and creative effort overall that relishes from it&apos;s visually brooding direction, superior lead performance and convincing monster design.",

                "reviewBody": "A cat spends the day chasing a mouse.  When he finally corners the mouse, he takes sadistic delight in batting it around, playing with it before it goes in for the kill.  The cat wishes to savor the look of fear on its prey, instead of merely indulging the reward it&apos;s worked so hard to catch.  This is the predator/prey relationship evidenced in &quot;The Hitcher,&quot; one of the most relentlessly intense and mean-spirited horror films ever made.\n\nSince the setting is the desert, I suppose it would make more sense to call John Ryder (played by Rutger Hauer) a vicious coyote, who is picked up one rainy night by a stray lamb named Jim Halsey (C. Thomas Howell).  Ryder, who&apos;s apparently been murdering people all over the desert, is looking to do the same with Halsey, who cheats death only to be tormented for the rest of the film by this savage predator.  The coyote craves a challenge--in fact, he seems to live for it.\n\nNothing else needs to be said.  &quot;The Hitcher&quot; relies so heavily on a plot that weaves in and out of &apos;the expected&apos; that any further description would spoil the fun.  The two leads are excellent--Rutger Hauer has created one of the great villains of modern cinema, and C. Thomas Howell is a sympathetic and believable victim driven to madness.  While the film isn&apos;t necessarily deep, the high-energy cast, moody desert settings and twisty script fuel this effort for 98 intense minutes.  3.5 stars out of 5.",

The car is given the name Christine and repays her owner&apos;s adoration by &quot;taking care of&quot; his enemies.\n\nIt is fun watching Keith Gordon, owner of Christine, go from wimp to self proclaimed stud. Also in the cast are: John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Harry Dean Stanton and David Spielberg.\n\nIt is super cool watching Christine repair her damaged parts. This is an underrated movie that deserves a repeat viewing.",

                "reviewBody": "The one that started it all: a franchise of over-the-top &quot;action,&quot; outrageous gore, and characters you often couldn&apos;t care less about. Yet in this one, none of those really apply. The death scenes are in ways subtle and clever, sometimes drawn out to exacerbate tension, while others are arguably very predictable, but nonetheless thrilling. The plane scene is chaotic and how it culminates, very intense. Aside from one decapitation, not much gore. Meanwhile the characters, in my opinion, are the best the series has had to offer, particularly thanks to Devon Sawa, and the personality he elicits in Alex Browning. Others satisfy, too, from Sean William Scott to Kerr Smith. There&apos;s some subtle humor, some drama, and some creativity to be had. As much praise as I have to offer the movie, it still has its many flaws and even silly moments. But for what it&apos;s worth, it was the beginning, and it remains a fun watch despite the slew of even more over-the-top installments that followed it.",

                "reviewBody": "Ghoulies (1985) \n\n* 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nLame rip-off of GREMLINS has a man moving into an old mansion where he eventually decides to bring out the title creatures who of course go on a killing spree. Apparently this thing started off as a higher-budget R-rated horror film but then the budget was slashed and they decided to aim at the kid market. Well, this here was obviously a mistake because what remains in the film is a semi-horror film that&apos;s too tame to go all the way yet at the same time there&apos;s really nothing here that would appeal to children. I think the producers forgot that they were trying to aim this at kids and instead us poor viewers were left to suffer. The story itself is a pretty silly one that takes way too long to get going. At just 82-minutes this film seems twice as long and this might be due to the fact that the actual ghoulies don&apos;t appear until around the forty-minute mark. Even when they do arrive they don&apos;t exactly bring any excitement with them as they&apos;re just not scary enough to have any impact. A lot of the violence is also off screen so gore fans aren&apos;t going to get any of that here. Even worse is that there are a couple sexual scenes here that have been toned down and in this condition they just really don&apos;t serve any purpose to the film. Of course, in a R-rated film they might have at least been used just to show off some cheap nudity. The performances are pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a film like this. John Carl Buechler does a fine job with the special effects but sadly they&apos;re not used nearly enough. GHOULIES might appeal to those who enjoy bad 80s movies but the rest should just stay clear."

Well, I am glad I stayed with it. It was very funny and a combination comedy and horror film. Yes, it&apos;s humor geared more for teens but people far older than 15 should still get a lot of laughs out of this.\n\nWarning: some of the scenes are pretty gross, at least for a comedy, but that&apos;s what made those particularly scenes funny. Comedy and horror mix well together, anyway.\n\nThe film reminded me a bit of &quot;American Werewolf in London&quot; with the &quot;undead&quot; kids. Despite the absurdity of it, there are a couple of good message in here....but, generally, this is purely escapist fun and nothing else.",

But soon enough their knowledge about how to kill some of these legendary creatures comes in mighty handy in their small town.\n\nAndre Gower and Robby Kiger head the group and it&apos;s a good thing their services were needed right at this point in time. By the look of them in another year these kids would be hitting puberty full stride, one of them Ryan Lambert is already showing inclination of interest in the opposite sex.\n\nBest scene in the film is during the climax when a virgin is needed to read an incantation and when it doesn&apos;t quite work because the virgin&apos;s not quite a virgin Gower&apos;s little sister is brought in as a pinch hitter. \n\nDuncan Regehr makes a fine, menacing Dracula topping the cast performance list. Regehr plays it absolutely straight for the young audience this film was aimed at.\n\nWith an original premise based on how Bud&amp;Lou got tangled up with all their monsters in Abbott&amp;Costello Meet Frankenstein and a climax which liberally borrowed from the Back To The Future films, The Monster Squad is still an enjoyable film for young audiences.",

                "reviewBody": "Oh my god. I think I might still be a little excited, since I just got back from the advance screening of Snakes on a Plane. I want to preface this review by saying that IT&apos;S NOT SERIOUS. DO NOT go to this film expecting to see some great, dramatic film because you&apos;ll be let down. However, if you want to go and see Samuel L. Jackson kick the holy sh*t out of snakes (on a plane) then this is the film for you. It&apos;s dumb B-movie summer fun, and it delivered it by the truckload. It knows it isn&apos;t serious (with that title, how could it be), and honestly, the whole time everyone involved is just having FUN with it. So go, sit back, have fun, and see some snakes (on a plane).\n\nThe plot on this bad-boy is razor thin with a pathetic, throw-away villain. After witnessing a murder, Sean (Nathan Phillips) is taken into protective custody by the FBI and more specifically, Jackson&apos;s Neville Flynn. He has to be flown from Hawaii to LA to testify and blah, blah, blah. Who cares, right? No one, seriously, NO ONE. Our villain, Eddie Kim, is worthless. We get two minutes or so of screen time from him. He&apos;s not the villain; the SNAKES are the villains!!!!! The real fireworks start when we GET ON THAT PLANE. You all know what&apos;s going to happen, so they don&apos;t waste (much) time building up to it. Eventually the snakes (on the plane) are released. People are bitten in hilarious and very painful fashion. Samuel L. Jackson has to control the situation in that bad-ass way that only he can, and he disposes of the snakes in downright hilarious ways (which I won&apos;t spoil, you have to see it to believe it). Most of your characters are generally stereotypes and some of the acting is wooden. Most of the characters are very clich\u00e9d and stupid as well, and they don&apos;t do the most logical things in the situations they are presented. But that&apos;s not what you care about. THAT&apos;S NOT IMPORTANT! What is important, is the fact, that there are SNAKES... ON A PLANE! It&apos;s cheesy, B-movie fun, and don&apos;t let anyone tell you any different. You want to see snakes on a plane, you&apos;re going to see snakes on a plane. Period. It also plays homage to some Jackson flicks of old, I&apos;ll let you decide which ones, since the scenes are obviously set up in that way. Try to think of other films Jackson has been in with reptiles.\n\nThe special effects were PRETTY good; it was obvious when you were looking at a CGI snake or a real snake, that much I can tell you. But it didn&apos;t matter. It doesn&apos;t take you out of the movie at all. The action is as good as you can expect from people whooping snakes and vice-versa. It was a good thriller, they kept it moving and didn&apos;t slow down, and they kept the tension riding high throughout the film. And it&apos;s FUNNY. It&apos;s funny if you expect it to be cheesy fun, and it is, and I was constantly laughing throughout. Even as snakes (on a plane) are killing people, you&apos;re laughing at it. It was just that good.\n\nI don&apos;t know what else I can say about this, except that if you have the chance, SEE THIS FILM OPENING WEEKEND. Get a crowd in there that wants to have good, dumb, popcorn-movie fun and you will have a blast. My theater was off the hook, and it&apos;s seriously the most fun I&apos;ve had at the movies in longer than I can remember. Go into this film knowing what it is and watch it with exactly that in mind and you&apos;ll have a GREAT time. Expect nothing from it and just let yourself have fun for a couple of hours. This film won&apos;t be the darling of the critics; it wasn&apos;t pre-screened because the makers KNOW what this film is and what they expect from it. I can&apos;t think of another instance where a film drew this kind of buzz on its title alone, and where everyone who went to see it completely knew it was going to be &quot;so bad it&apos;s good.&quot; And it really is. Kudos to the studio that ordered re-shoots after all the buzz on the internet kicked in, it really shines. And thanks for the &quot;line&quot; which is quoted at the head of the review. Everyone in my theater said it with him, and EVERYONE was cheering.\n\nSnakes on a Plane has landed. And it&apos;s good summer fun. With snakes. On a plane. Eight out of ten stars.\n\n\n* Sgt. Fluffy\n",

This did have a made-for-TV feel about it similar to other King flicks, but imo, the reason this was acceptable was in large part due to the acting and casting of Robert John Burke. Can you imagine seeing this man walk his dog at night? He seems outside the human race somehow\u0085I guess that&apos;s why they choose acting as a profession. He so not normal. His voice quality was over the top, Simpson-esq in quality like in a cartoon\u0085but that worked here.\n\nJoe Mantegna and Michael Constantine were excellent. As stated previously, Kari Wuhrer is smokin&apos; hot. Too bad she looks exactly like that Doritos girl who is on a UON stupid sitcom now. I guess you can&apos;t have two Doritos girls in Hollyweird.\n\nYou gotta love IMDb.com to look up all the work these actors have done. I knew I saw Burke and Wuhrer&apos;s face before but couldn&apos;t place them. I thought Michael Constantine was James Coco\u0085but only tonight I saw Constantine in The Hustler w/Paul Newman, one of his first roles. IMDb confirmed this.\n\nEven found out Joe&apos;s wife owns a pizza place in Burbank...need to stop by.",

Even better it moves quickly (it&apos;s only 78 minutes) and never stops. Very scary and unsettling. It was remade in the US as &quot;Quarantine&quot; in 2008. That&apos;s good too but this is better!",

                "reviewBody": "After a villainous ventriloquist&apos;s dummy is delivered to the home of handsome Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten), and his pretty wife Lisa (Laura Regen), this perfidious puppet very soon belies its inert demeanour, as &apos;Billy&apos; utilizing murderous means most macabre dispatches Kwanten&apos;s pale Mia Farrow Lookalike wife in an especially jaw-droppingly diabolical manner! Thusly burdened with grief, our dishy widower high-tails it to his gloomily dilapidated Silent Hill-esque home-town in his ubiquitous Hollywood hero&apos;s muscle car in order to discover the possibility of there being some monstrous truth behind the childhood rhyme extolling the evil exploits of malevolent Mary Shaw and her supremely sinister 101 Dollnation had anything to do with his sinuous spouse&apos;s savage snuffing out! A goodly number of noughties &apos;horror&apos; films are based on creepy urban legends, and James Wan&apos;s predictably jump-scare laden &apos;Dead Silence&apos; rigorously maintains the zeitgeist. The sleekly fashioned fright-flick reeks of Hollywood artifice, from the screamingly obvious polystyrene tombs, plentiful usage of Fright Night fog, and delightfully hokey, hunchback-less Guignol theatre, wherein the grim-faced Mary Shaw&apos;s infamous legend was so menacingly born!\n\nWhile the shocks are somewhat muted, perhaps in an attempt to avoid the boggle-eyed wrath of hissy missy Mary, the film&apos;s more endearing qualities are the delicious comedy stylings of a deadpan Donnie Wahlberg as the wryly disdainful cop Detective Lipton, his colourful performance increasing the faux-Gothic campery herein. For me, as a horror film-maker, Wan is a somewhat pallid practitioner, but the dude has legit comedy chops, to whit, the blackly funny, wickedly witty &apos;Tales From The Crypt&apos; twist, and if all noughties horror titles were replete with a similarly cartoonish cynical cop like Donnie I&apos;d be more of a fan! While &apos;Dead Silence&apos; is about as scary as a mislaid till receipt, it proved to be all so fabulously absurd I couldn&apos;t help but dig it! Usually I relish the dire misfortune that descends so fatally upon the expensively coiffed heads of Hollywood&apos;s perfectly plastic protagonists, but in this rare instance I had enormous empathy for the dotty old dear gibbering benignly away in the mortician&apos;s cobwebbed cellar, this truly darling, whimsical white-haired octogenarian Marion Walker (Joan Heney), and dynamic cop Donnie got me rooting for &apos;em right till the final curtain, mayte! One of the more aesthetically pleasing aspects of &apos;Dead Silence&apos; is the splendidly evocative chiaroscuro photography of talented DP John R. Lionetti, this gifted fellow also lensed the deliciously skewed, greatly underappreciated Lindsay Lohan oddity &apos;I Know Who Killed Me&apos;.",

In fear, the children join forces and take refuge in a derelict church, where they are forced to strike back at those who might wish to do them harm.\n\nChildren of the Damned is generally considered to be a sequel to the excellent Village of the Damned; however, when viewed like this, glaring anomalies prevent it from being a fully satisfying experience. Children of the Damned is therefore best viewed as a standalone project; seen in this way, the film is more than worthy of any sci-fi/horror fan&apos;s time\u2014an intelligent, thought-provoking piece that raises religious, ethical and philosophical debates and which, depending on how the somewhat ambiguous ending is interpreted, also delivers a prophetic warning: unless humans can overcome their innate distrust and fear of that which they do not understand, there can be no hope of survival for mankind.\n\nOpinion about which of the &apos;of the Damned&apos; films is better is seriously divided, but given the choice, I would always go for the freaky, blonde-haired and undeniably malevolent mutants of &apos;Village&apos; over the normal looking, multi-cultural, and possibly benevolent saviours of mankind from &apos;Children&apos;.

Shot on location with unknowns and local residents as extras. And the local butcher donated the entrails.\n\nThink Ginger Snaps, which started as an obscure Canadian horror flick but found an audience because of the great writing and the charisma of its stars.\n\nWhat we have here is another attempt to strike film gold by going for a high I/B ratio.\n\nA small cast. Minimal special effects. No special sets or backgrounds.\n\nA really clever idea, sort of a take off on the Ring which itself was a riff off a Japanese horror classic.\n\nSo what&apos;s the bottom line? Well done for what you get. Writer/Director Mitchell has a heck of a career ahead of him. Several &quot;jump out of your seat&quot; moments. And also a plot riff which you just know was contributed by some of the frat boys who crowd-sourced the film -- &quot;you can get rid of the curse if you just sleep with someone, fast!&quot; \n\nThe bad news? It is not in the same class as Living Dead or Ginger. There are lulls. There are gaps. There are times you start to wish you have purchased the extra large popcorn and coke.\n\nGreat career launch.",

Unlike &quot;The Ring&quot; which equaled and even improved on the original story in some ways, this one just meanders along in an uninspired fashion.\n\nThe original Japanese film, &quot;Ju-on&quot;, was pretty incoherent, mostly just a series of set pieces and great chills. The American version, directed by the same filmmaker, has done nothing towards clarifying the muddled story and, aside from the great opening sequences, is just a straight-forward recreation of the same suspenseful sequences that somehow don&apos;t play as well. I&apos;d suggest renting the original instead.\n\n5 out of 10.",

                "reviewBody": "Brian Krause (&apos;Charmed&apos;) and Alice Krige (&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;) play a son-and-mother pair, the title creatures who are vaguely feline in origin. They live a nomadic existence, moving from town to town and obtaining sustenance from the life force of teenage virgins. Their one weakness? Cats. Apparently any substantial scratch from a cat is enough to kill a Sleepwalker. Trouble arises for Krause and Krige when their current intended victim (Madchen Amick, &apos;Twin Peaks&apos;) turns out to be a real fighter.\n\nDon&apos;t take this screen original from Stephen King seriously - at all - and it&apos;s possible to have a generous amount of fun, as I did. It&apos;s positively goofy stuff, with some incredibly groan-inducing moments, but since most of the laughs do seem to be intentional, I was able to forgive this sort of thing. It&apos;s pretty predictable, to be sure, with most of the adult characters or authority figures proving to be completely useless. The visual effects by Apogee are pretty good, and Tony Gardners&apos; Alterian Studios supplies some decent-looking monsters. Another bonus: &quot;Sparks&quot;, the cat who plays Clovis, is every bit as appealing as human protagonist Amick.\n\nA solid assortment of familiar faces helps matters: real-life former couple Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward, who&apos;d played Matthew Brodericks&apos; parents in &quot;Ferris Bueller&apos;s Day Off&quot;, as Tanyas&apos; folks, Ron &quot;Hellboy&quot; Perlman as a moronic state trooper, Jim Haynie (&quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;) as the sheriff, Rusty Schwimmer (&quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot;) as a housewife, Stuart Charno (&quot;Friday the 13th Part 2&quot;) as a crime scene photographer, and the late Tim Burton favorite Glenn Shadix (&quot;Beetlejuice&quot;) as a creepy teacher. There&apos;s also a handful of quick cameos from genre icons, and Mark Hamill appears unbilled in the opening pre-credits sequence.\n\nI would tend to agree that BY NO MEANS would this ever be considered a &quot;great&quot; film, but it provides ample entertainment for horror fans. It does make great use of Enyas&apos; haunting song &quot;Boadicea&quot;.\n\nSeven out of 10.",

                "reviewBody": "Being a fan of supernatural, science fiction movies such as Fire In The Sky, The Forgotten, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Knowing, The Arrival, Contact, Night Skies etcetera I had high hopes for Dark Skies. The result was a better than average genre mash up that borrows elements from the best including my all time favorite horror film Poltergeist. The story was gripping that involves a suburban family that we instantly relate to and care about, making the chilling events that follow effective and downright surreal. The film takes an old-school approach when it comes to developing the story and characters and delivering the frights, which might be too much of a slow burn for fans of fast paced horror flicks. I happen to like how the film took its time delivering the details and made it a suspenseful and mind boggling watch even if it raises more questions than answers. In real life though, there is events out there that were can&apos;t explain or have answers for, which makes this quote even the more true that showed at the beginning of this film: &quot;Two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe, or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.&quot; \u2014 Arthur C. Clarke \n\nThe performances hit it home for me even though it wasn&apos;t always as emotionally powerful as it should have been. Keri Russell isn&apos;t in enough movies as she should be, but when she does make a movie her performances are always genuine and for surprisingly her horror film, this role fits like a glove and gives a raw and layered performance. Keri plays wife and mother of two boys Lacy Barrett, who is a struggling realtor trying to make ends meet while her husband Daniel Barrett played effortlessly by Josh Hamilton, tries desperately to find a better job to support their family. Right away their peaceful suburban life is turned upside down when they become under attack by strange supernatural forces. The child stars of this film were also impressive. Dakota Goyo and Kadan Rockett give natural and unflinching performances as the sons Jesse Barrett and Sam Barrett, who are just as confused and terrified of the strange events as their parents, but also show their own coming of age story on the side. J.K. Simmons gives a standout performance as Edwin Pollard, a man that the parents turn to for help as he knows exactly what they are going through, for he has dealt with the presence for some time. His role could of gone on the silly side but it was handled with such seriousness that you to will be on the edge of your seat with his accusations.\n\nDirector and writer, Scott Stewart delivers a nice change of pace and more of a restraint here compared to his other films Legion, which I was one of the few that actually enjoyed it and Priest, which I haven&apos;t seen yet but want to soon. This type of style seems to be more of his niche and has a more plausible approach even if he doesn&apos;t have answers for but that&apos;s fine because in real life we don&apos;t as well. I like that he went with mood, suspense, characters and story over cheap scares, over use of CGI and gore which makes the film have an old-school vibe which brought me back to horror movies of the past like Poltergeist mixed with The X-Files, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Signs for instance. The Fact that he waits until the end to reveal the creepy beings make you sit in constant suspense, even though they could of done a much better job with their digital appearance and gone with more natural FX to make the reveal all the more terrifyingly effective. It could of been worse though so it was fine; the ending leaves you on a cliffhanger and has possibilities of a sequel in the future that I&apos;m very intrigued by and hope they go through with one.\n\nOverall, another horror movie out of left field that is way better than what most critics make it out to be. It&apos;s a shame that not a whole lot of people went to go see it, as it might be the more decent horror films of the year, so far at least. If you like slow burn horror movies with suspense, you will probably enjoy this but don&apos;t expect a whole lot of action or scares just a slow building nightmare.",

I know that this movie is beyond silly, but I think sometimes you need a villain that doesn&apos;t take himself too seriously, this movie made fun of leprechauns along with making it into an interesting horror movie. Come on, you have got to admit that that little leprechaun was one scary looking creature! Warwick Davis is just so awesome, I don&apos;t get how you could not love him, or be scared of him as the Leprechaun.\n\nLeprechaun is about a daughter and a father move into an old house where the previous owner has gone insane and trapped a leprechaun in the house they moved into. The one thing that is keeping the leprechaun in the box is a four leaf clover. Jennifer Anniston in one of her earliest roles is a prissy Beverly Hills girl who meets Nathan, a hunky carpenter who is helping them out with the house, and his two friends Ozzie, a mentally challenged man and his little brother, Alex. When Ozzie goes down to the basement, he accidentally knocks the clover off the create, the leprechaun escapes! He also wants his pot of gold that Ozzie and Alex found and will kill to get it! \n\nI know there are some major cheesy scenes, but they are just so laughable, you know, like the so bad it&apos;s good type of thing? I think that&apos;s why Leprechaun is a cult classic and a guilty pleasure for most. You just need to have fun and not take it so seriously as a horror movie. Warwick Davis is just a great leprechaun and he made it into a fun franchise! \n\n7/10",

                "reviewBody": "&quot;This ain&apos;t no funeral parlor. This ain&apos;t the terrordome. Welcome to HELL mothaf*#%@!&quot; In not too many words I want to express my respect for one of the most underrated horror movies of the 90s. Like The Twilight Zone it is a segmented film (although all directed by Rusty Cundieff) that spans across a good variety of horror genres. The real horrorshow here, though, is the domestic/racial issues against the black community. Cleverly (and without being preachy or offensive to white people), Cundieff disguised his agenda with rich characters and a bone chilling conclusion.\n\nThe HIGHPOINT of this movie for me is the film&apos;s proverbial ringleader- a funeral parlor director. The man, brilliantly and hilariously underplayed by a bug-eyed Clarence Williams III, finds a stack of drugs he wants to sell to three young hoods. As you watch you begin to wonder what eerie agenda he really has in store. These scenes tie all the vignettes together.\n\nAlso, the final segment is a very profound statement on gang violence (although beware, this is the preachiest segment). I like to call it A Clockwork Black because it applies Anthony Burgress&apos;s idea of reversing violence onto the offender onto a gang leader called Krazy K. Those K&apos;s in his name aren&apos;t a mistake either! Cundieff underlines a necessary argument about between black-on-black violence by comparing K to a neo nazi.\n\nLike any memorable work of horror, Tales remembers to keep its monsters metaphorical. Police brutality, domestic violence, racial profiling, and gang violence are the most hideous creatures found here. I complement Rusty Cundieff on a job well done there. Excessive campiness and at-times generic camera work keep this from being great, but nothing stops its relevance in the genre.\n\nSTAR RATING: *** out of 4.",

                "reviewBody": "Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) is big bad butcher, whose weapon of choice is a mallet and an ice hook. Day after day, night after night he takes the 2 am train to hell, where unsuspecting passengers are massacred and then hung up like dead meat.\n\nLeon (Bradley Cooper) is an up and coming photograph, who is trying to make it critically, but so far his work has been unable to break it. His biggest fan and believer is his beautiful fianc\u00e9e Maya (Leslie Bibb). One chance session in the subway changes the direction of his life. First he photographs a model being harassed by some thugs and after saving her from them takes a picture of her entering the 2 am train...\n\nClive Barker has really been prolific with all the horror he has caused come to life on the big screen. It is enough to mention that his stories was the backbone of such classics as Hellraiser or Candyman. That said he has also been raped as a horror writer with atrocities such as Rawhead Rex.\n\nThis movie doesn&apos;t hit the highs or the lows, but I must say it was pretty decent and definitely one of the best genre movies I have seen lately. No matter has essentially idiotic the plot I have to say it did cut loose of the copycat phase in horror cinema we are currently at. It had a certain freshness to it not only in the way it was told, but also in subject matter itself. I won&apos;t go as far as to say it was breakthrough original, but it was darn intriguing all the way through.\n\nI normally rate a good horror movie based on gut feeling. The moment you can&apos;t wait to know what will happen at the end of the movie or in the next scene for that matter and at the same time you have to fight with yourself to continue watching - that lets you know this horror flick is actually pretty good.\n\nDefinitely full of flaws and the graphic gore isn&apos;t my kind of horror meal. Acting was great and tech credits all round were superb. Ry\u00fbhei Kitamura deserves accolades for this horror movie. Maybe not a classic, but given the far fetched material he had to work with it is a triumph.",

The film is pretty gruesome considering these were based on true events. This film is okay though keeps the suspense. The movie was a bit dragged and took a while for the killers to prey even though most scenes they could have killed the couple on the spot. Though, I guess that&apos;s just part of their game. I would recommend the film for those looking for a light thrill.\n\nKristen: &quot;Why are you doing this to us?&quot; Dollface: &quot;Because you were home.&quot;-The Strangers",

I&apos;m also pretty late in watching this movie. I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon&apos;s name in the credits for producing and writing. \n\nOverall, I loved this movie. It started off as your typical horror film, but turn into something much bigger and more authentic. Every horror in the past twenty years has been predictable. You know who is going to die, you know who the killer is, you know if the dumb blonde runs off screaming into a dark hallway she&apos;s more than likely going to have her head get cut off. But this movie was the exact opposite because I had absolutely no clue what was going to happen next. I&apos;m sure a high percentage of people will not appreciate the sci-fi twist to the movie but I loved and thought it was an awesome idea. All horror movies are kind of science fiction anyways. It seems like all the killers are super human anyway because they don&apos;t seem to ever die no matter how many times you shoot them, stab them or hit them with a truck. This movie just did it on a larger scale.\n\nThe script was solid as well. Joss Whedon writes the best dialogue and knows how to play off of clich\u00e9&apos;s and those corny predictable monologues and speeches. \n\nTo everyone saying they hated this movie, it&apos;s obvious that they don&apos;t like change and are probably upset because the originality of this film pretty much slays all their favorite horror movies to dust. It&apos;s not Oscar worthy but it&apos;s a great Friday night movie with your friends that will keep everyone on the edge of their seat, anticipating what&apos;s going to happen next.\n\nI have to hand it to the filmmakers. They definitely made a film that no one would have ever thought it. Just like my title says, you either love it or you hate it. You can&apos;t please everyone but this customer was satisfied from beginning.",

                "reviewBody": "If you&apos;ve seen this film, you have an opinion on it. And this is natural given the open ended finale of the movie. For those who haven&apos;t seen the movie--don&apos;t worry--I don&apos;t plan on ruining it by saying anything in this review that you wouldn&apos;t know by seeing the preview or anything that would detract from your viewing experience? at least I&apos;ll try not to.\n\nThe highlight of the movie for me was Pastor Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian). He succeeded in weaving together a layered, complex character which is rare for the horror genre. He plays a southern Baptist minister who grew up in the church. As a PK, he was bred to be on the pulpit. One would think that with a lifetime spent in the church, his faith would be devout--quite the opposite. As years have passed, his faith has weakened to a point where now even he doubts.\n\nAnother huge plus for me in this film are the ups and downs--one minute your knees are at your chest and you&apos;re on the verge of covering your eyes, and the next you&apos;re lost in the development of the plot.\n\nNo matter what your thoughts on the end of the movie, I challenge someone to dispute the merits of a scary movie to put more emphasis on character development to further the suspense than the typically cheap thrills.",

                "reviewBody": "A gang kills two detectives and breaks out criminal Krug (Garret Dillahunt). Competitive swimmer Mari Collingwood (Sara Paxton) and her parents (Monica Potter, Tony Goldwyn) go to their vacation home. Mari reconnects with local friend Paige (Martha MacIsaac). The girls go to a motel room with Justin (Spencer Treat Clark) with the promise of some marijuana. They have a fun time until Justin&apos;s dad Krug, uncle Francis (Aaron Paul) and Sadie (Riki Lindhome) arrive. The girls are kidnapped and then Mari causes the car to crash.\n\nAs far as violent horrors go, this works better than most. The first half is the most compelling. The rape scene is pretty brutal. The violence is scary without the enjoyable fun. It&apos;s a horrific scene. The scariest part is actually the motel scene where the violence is just threatened. The second half is less scary by comparison. It&apos;s more traditional with the Collingwood family battling the criminal family. The whole movie works pretty well with some memorable brutality.",

This movie was brilliant and a refreshing change from all the Hollywood junk about killer dolls and such. By the middle of the movie you actually care whether the characters get out or not. The scenes in this film were well filmed and the location was absolutely breath taking. Stick around for the credits on this one boys and girls. You&apos;ll definitely find it interesting. The last time I was this impressed with a werewolf movie was Silver Bullet. I would even put this film with An American Werewolf in London. It has some excellent acting, character development and if you see this keep your eye on Pvt. Spooner! You&apos;ll remember him come the end of the movie! I would give this flick four stars for sure!",

Prying eyes staring from behind a curtain.\n\nOh, at some point vampires come flying through the window, and it&apos;s still fine by me, it&apos;s one of the better vampire films and at 3 hours it&apos;s better fleshed than most of them; but I am just not attuned to the whole vampire lore so I leave this part to be enjoyed best by the traditional horror fan. It is actually one of the more potent retellings of the most familiar story in this field, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not quite Dracula but that older film with longer shadows, so I will not spoil the discovery for you.\n\nBut the first part intrigues me in stranger ways, more suggestive, with menace that goes unspoken. The small-town facade that would later resurface in Twin Peaks.\n\nThere is a notion that matters in all this, but which is not pursued at all; the writer who feels from his perspective that it was his presence that awakened evil, it&apos;s fitting that it&apos;s coming from a writer because it&apos;s a self-centered, imaginative notion, but which from our end we know is bogus. Evil was already afoot, and was never centered around him. But he wistfully imagines himself at the center so he can write about it.\n\nSo I don&apos;t know what happened with Tobe Hooper. He was never very elegant with a camera, the way Argento was or occasionally Carpenter, but he was unmatched in his feel for the aural qualities of film. He could make a room hum with evil. My guess is that, being an intuitive maker, the feel came and went, or he forgot how to tap into it (you can see as early as Eaten Alive how he seems to be desperately trying to capture again the muse that gave him Texas Massacre). Or he plainly stopped actively chasing after the right material.\n\nThis was just right for him. Only Kubrick has better adapted Stephen King to my mind."

                "reviewBody": "The Purge (2013)\n\n* 1/2 (out of 4)\n\nAnnoying, dumb and eventually cruel film dealing with the one day of the year when America allows you to kill anyone who want without being punished. This &quot;purge&quot; is supported by a security system seller (Ethan Hawke) and his wife (Lena Headey) but during the 12-hour period they find themselves the target of a gang of murderers. THE PURGE pretty much gave away its story during the theatrical trailer and I thought to myself that we were going to get something fresh or something that has a few interesting ideas but just didn&apos;t work. Sadly there are some interesting ideas floating around but the screenplay is simply so bad and so clich\u00e9d that it pretty much kills anything positive. The biggest problem is that the film is never scary, which is just downright disappointing. Another problem is that the film itself doesn&apos;t know what to do with its &quot;free day to kill&quot; idea. It takes a while for the viewer to warm up to this futuristic world where we can kill but as soon as you accept this &quot;law&quot; the screenplay then pulls a quick one and starts to challenge the morals of such a thing. We then get a bunch of political non-sense thrown in just to make us question the whole thing. Why sell a film on an idea and then not know where to get with it? Even more annoying is that this film contains some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of cinema. Yes, the history of cinema. The couple&apos;s young son is someone I wanted to be off the screen ASAP. The daughter isn&apos;t much better but just wait until the two twists that happen. Both Hawke and Headey give good performances as does the rest of the cast. If you&apos;re expecting a horror film then you&apos;re going to be disappointed because even though there&apos;s quite a bit of violence, for the most part this is nothing more than a rip-off of STRAW DOGS but set in the future with this one &quot;change.&quot; Sadly, THE PURGE just never works and in the end you&apos;re left with a major disappointment and just a cheap excuse to kill."

The terror due to their predicament mounts minute by minute and is made genuine by showing a harsh environment and by imposing tension on each of the characters. The cast is not famous at all but the way the story is set and the three personalities are described keeps attention and tension high and strong. I recommend it also for the wonderful location (movie shot in Utah&apos;s Rockies).",

                "reviewBody": "It is clear that the current cycle of horror remakes is far from over and the results so far have for the most part been surprisingly good. This trend continues with &apos;The Crazies&apos;- a reinvention of George Romero&apos;s little-seen 1973 original. The plot is beyond simple: a biological agent gets into the water supply of a small town in Iowa called Ogden Marsh and turns the inhabitants into homicidal maniacs. Things get even worse when a US Army unit initiates a brutal containment operation where shooting first and not bothering to ask questions is the order of the day.\n\nThe film wastes little time building up to the first outbreak of insanity and then chillingly portrays how the town&apos;s social fabric is obliterated at break-neck speed. There is an abundance of scary moments, inventive gore, and even some very black humor. Some moments are so intensely suspenseful that time seems to practically stand still. All the cast play their parts well; including Timothy Olyphant as the town sheriff, Joe Anderson as his deputy, and Radha Mitchell as the town doctor. The minimalist soundtrack is also strikingly effective. All in all, this film is a treat for horror fans and for anyone looking for an intense night out at the movies.",

                "reviewBody": "Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film&apos;s effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters&apos; ordeals horrifically real. The movie&apos;s plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The film&apos;s cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to &apos;banjo territory&apos; - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region&apos;s tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.",

                "reviewBody": "When I saw that the average rating for this film was only a 4, I felt compelled to write about this captivating low budget endeavor. Blood is listed on IMDb as a horror film, when actually it should be categorized as a thriller. Does it have a vampire? Well, yes and no, as Lix, the Antagonist(?) of the story must survive on human blood. The crux is that Lix&apos;s blood is a narcotic for normal humans, and is highly addictive. This of course leads to all sorts of erotic sexuality involving blood between her and the doctor who genetically created her, who quickly becomes an addict. As with all romance and sex involving human blood, things cannot end well. The film has an excellent plot, moves along well, and the acting is very good. The actress who plays Lix is erotic and innocent at the same time, and Adrian Rawlins is superb as the doctor/geneticist who gives up everything for his addiction. Will keep you on the edge of your seat.",

                "reviewBody": "&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;\n\nWith &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, the misunderstood &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;, the underrated &quot;Long Kiss Goodnight&quot; and guilty pleasure (but pretty damn good) &quot;Adventures Of Ford Fairlane&quot;, Renny Harlin has proven himself time and again as one of the most visually competent action directors around. I&apos;ve always stood behind his work, I sincerely love most of his movies. With &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, Harlin is in the midst of trying to keep his career going due to the low box office take of his previous films. The result is a movie that&apos;s on autopilot. An attempt to reclaim the respect of the studios and the audience with a slam-bang summer film that gets the job done easily, you just won&apos;t respect it in the morning.\n\nMaybe the largest problem in &quot;Deep Blue&quot; is the casting. Saffron Burrows and Thomas Jane lead the cast that also includes Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, and Michael Rapaport. Both Burrows and Jane give what can only be described as seriously lacking performances. As the members of a science and research team in a state-of-the-art ocean facility off the coast of Baja, Mexico, the crew is in the midst of a study on sharks. The sharks hold the key to a possible cure for Alzheimer&apos;s disease and other brain dysfunctions(explained more thoroughly in the trailer for the film than in the actual film). The scientists have enlarged the brain of the beasts, making them smarter and faster. When a corporate executive (Jackson) arrives for a tour of the facility, the sharks begin an uprising that threatens the crew&apos;s very existence. Out in the middle of nowhere, the team tries to survive both the sharks and the sinking structure. \n\nSaffron Burrows is just the wrong choice for the lead scientist role. Her British monotone ruined a bad film (&quot;Wing Commander&quot;) and brought down a good one (&quot;The Loss Of Sexual Innocence&quot;). I don&apos;t believe she has that much talent besides her beauty, and her lethargic presence here directly conflicts with the high-octane action that surrounds her. Thomas Jane on the other hand, was good in the role of Dirk Diggler&apos;s drug-dealing friend in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. He seemed more alive in 30 minutes of screen time in that film than all 95 minutes of &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;. I&apos;m a bit surprised that nobody mentioned the lack of enthusiasm during filming. For the lead role, the film needed someone who can burst off the screen with fury and charm. Jane has neither. He leaves the film all wet.\n\nSaying that &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; needed better acting might be stretching it a bit. This is a action film with plenty of thrills and many explosions. You cannot expect Shakespeare when you buy a ticket to this. Still, the script credited to three writers is very weak(I assume large parts of the story were cut for time) and the score by Trevor Rabin is the blandest, most perfunctory music to hit the ears in a long time. Hopes were really high for this, but all the bad parts add up quickly.\n\nHarlin&apos;s specialty is the action sequence. He&apos;s one of the few directors left who knows how to squeeze the audience just right. &quot;Deep Blue&quot; is filled with wonderful suspense sequences and a genuine amount of anxiety. The computer-generated sharks move with alarming speed and dexterity. They keep the patrons on their toes. I cannot remember the last time I heard an audience scream with fear. Harlin milks every moment for the most thrills. I was very tense throughout the film. Rare for a guy as jaded as me.\n\nThe comparison to &quot;Jaws&quot; is very unfortunate. Just because the film features sharks doesn&apos;t immediately suggest a &quot;Jaws&quot; ripoff. We have had about 10 high school films with interchangeable plots and identical climaxes, yet nobody bats an eye over that. &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; stands alone with it&apos;s rousing thrills and deeply undernourished script. &quot;Jaws&quot; it ain&apos;t.\n\nIt&apos;s hot and the summer is about 3/4 of the way through. Escapism with &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; or &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; is impossible. &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; feeds the good old need of action, action, and more action. It&apos;s summer entertainment in the highest order, and damn it, the thing works. Hopefully Harlin can rebound in the future with better material. For now, this is the best source of thrills for the summer. ---------- 7"

                "name": "The Host",
                "reviewBody": "The Host is by far one of the best monster movies in years. The movie follows a bumbling young father, Gang-Do Park, and his family. The story starts like every monster movie; everything is calm and uneventful, &quot;business as usual&quot; you might say. When a mutated fish creature comes along the river bank and begins killing anyone in its path. Amidst all of the confusion, Gang-Do&apos;s daughter, Hyun-seo, is picked up by the monster and dragged back to the sewer. The story then turns into a search for Hyun-seo. Gang-Do and his family evade the authorities and use all the money they have to desperately continue their quest.\n\nThe reason I picked up this movie in the first place is because the box said that it was &quot;on par with Jaws.&quot; I found this hard to believe but the monster in The Host is the one of the most cinematically pleasing CG creations in recent years and is probably the most original looking monster since Alien. It was legitimately scary looking and had a very unique style of moving that set it apart from previous monsters. Another strength of this monster is how well the CG is done. It does not just look like some computer generated figure spliced into live action footage. It looks like it belongs in the shot. The monster also has enough on screen time to make the movie suspenseful. The movie keeps the viewer wanting to see more of the monster while, at the same time, keeping them satisfied with the number of appearances.\n\nThe Park family does a pretty good job of keeping the audience entertained while the monster is off screen. The relationship that Gang-Do shares with his father, &quot;college man&quot; brother, and professional archer sister maintains a balance of drama and humor that the audience can appreciate. This dynamic seems strange but the movie makes it work. You start to really feel like these people are family. The best thing about these characters is that you are not disappointed when they are on the screen. Some monster movies seem to get kind of boring when the monster is off screen (Godzilla 1998).\n\nThe weakest thing about this movie, as it is with most foreign films, is the English translation and dubbing. After a while it becomes bearable but in the beginning it sounds absolutely awful. I don&apos;t say this very often because, like many Americans, I hate reading subtitles. But I think this one time I would have made the exception because the voice acting was just terrible. They just didn&apos;t seem to fit the characters very well. The dialogue in some scenes is very awkward as well. Some of the English translation just sounds out of place. This happens a lot with language barriers, however, and sometimes it just cannot be helped. If you want to watch something that is not meant to be in your language, you&apos;ve just got to go with what you get.\n\nI started off saying that this is one of the best monster movies in years, and it is. It&apos;s not perfect, but what monster movie is? It has some flaws but the originality of the monster and the simplicity of the plot makes this movie very easy to follow and worth watching at the very least. It is pretty good for what it is. The whole &quot;monster terrorizing an Asian town&quot; seems like it has been done a million times (because it has), but this movie has some new things to offer. Would I call this movie &quot;on par with Jaws&quot;? I wouldn&apos;t personally, but it is definitely better than some of the cheesy messes that monster movies have made in the past.",

It was pretty well done, I just thought it was a little too drawn out. I feel like Keifer as usual does great with his role, but overacting especially towards the end was a bit eh. Oh and I actually thought they did pretty good tying up the ending. A lot of people complain the last part ruined the film or wasn&apos;t good, but it surprised me as I thought it would be much worse. I say it&apos;s worth checking out if you haven&apos;t. It wasn&apos;t groundbreaking or anything but managed to keep me focused for a few hours. I give it a 6. I liked it better than Aja&apos;s High Tension. Now to me that was a bad ending.",

                "reviewBody": "Black Sabbath is one visually stylish flick, courtesy of one of Italy&apos;s finest; Mario Bava.\n\nThe first story, The Telephone, is light on suspense but heavy on looks. The first Giallo in color, I believe, to some extent, with sexual overtones featured very prominently. Although it only takes place in one apartment Bava&apos;s crazy color schemes work beautifully and thanks to the two stunning ladies this episode goes down very well.\n\nThe Wurdulak scores heavy because of it&apos;s visuals and it&apos;s magnificent Gothic atmosphere. This should give a good example of how Black Sunday might have looked in color. However, this episode feels stretched quite a bit, it&apos;s relatively short running time seems longer than it is and therefore, in my opinion, is the weakest of the bunch.\n\nThe Drop of Water is the final, and best, episode. Bava was fond of the kind of horror that deals with a person who&apos;s totally alone in his/her surroundings. He goes into supernatural territory and creates a highly stylish (again) and quite the scary episode.\n\nBlack Sabbath is not the best Mario Bava has to offer, it could have been more scary but thanks to studio involvement he had to keep things light and not too scary. Under such restrictions I think Bava did extremely well and Black Sabbath is most definitely a must for Bava fans.",

                "reviewBody": "Ginger Snaps is a low budget Canadian horror film that also has a subtext of growing up and puberty.\n\nBridgette (Emily Perkins) and Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) are two sisters who are very close and have fascination about death. They stage and photograph death scenes and regarded as weird at High School where they are regarded as outcasts and suffer from bullying. Ginger is one year older than Bridgette and is starting her period rather late.\n\nGinger gets attacked by a werewolf very close to her first period and her body undergoes changes. Hair, mood swings, pains, bleeding, sexualisation and a tail. You see the parallels to growing up and becoming a werewolf. Heck there is even a 28 day cycle!\n\nOf course as the blood lust takes effect Ginger gets more savage and starts to kill. This is after the guys at High School find her hot and appealing which means she has no trouble attracting victims. Its left to Bridgette and high school drug dealer Sam to find a cure for lycanthropy and save Ginger.\n\nThere is nothing much original about a werewolf film. Writer Karen Walton has given this film a feminist twist and a lot of it is due to the bond between the two sisters and Bridgette wanting to save Ginger out of that love.\n\nDirector John Fawcett goes for a more realistic portrayal of High School life and more honest representation of family relationships when children hit adolescent. Mimi Rogers plays the mother and although the father does not speak a lot when he does his remarks are rather waspish.\n\nThe film suffers slightly from its low budget and it could been tighter. I think the climax loses its way a bit and should had been better presented.\n\nIts a rare combination of intellectual horror and dark comedy which works to an extent but never quiet pulls it off successfully.",

The Death of his mother,the want to beat Death, all of these factors formed Frankenstein up to the moment where he creates and reanimates the Monster\n\nAh, The Monster.. In all the excitement I almost forget Robert De Niro&apos;s excellent rendition of the monster. In his characterization the monster isn&apos;t just a lifeless and soulless being,but a humane being with wishes,desires,wants and lusts..\n\nHe feels and experiences everything with such a strenght and intensity as noone really can describe. And he tries to adapt to a world which is completely hostile to his existence, even his Father he learns will not love him or know him.\n\nThe Monster is like a child, trying to cope with emotions and feelings much stronger than anything we can imagine or percieve. And maybe it is that which makes the Monster so reckognizable?. Because he is us, and we are him?"

                "reviewBody": "BARBARA STEELE became an icon of horror films (the way Christopher Lee did when he played Dracula), when she played the role of a vampire witch princess burned at the stake in the 17th century who returns two hundred years later with a vengeance. Not that the story itself is all that original, but when done as stylishly as it is here, with the perfect B&amp;W atmosphere and chiller mood, it&apos;s a winner.\n\nThere&apos;s no let-up in suspense from the gripping opening scene where the mask of Satan is nailed onto the face of the poor victimized woman, even though the unfolding of the story is rather slow. The graveyard scene of an undead man rising from the earth is masterfully photographed. The mood becomes more and more intense as several key characters emerge as vampires.\n\nAs a young doctor who figures importantly in the plot, JOHN RICHARDSON is a rather wooden actor and makes a cardboard hero, but in a film that relies on its effect for brilliant camera-work and Gothic touches, it&apos;s not much of a flaw. Barbara Steele&apos;s impassive mask-like beauty is suitable in the eerie dual role she plays with wide-eyed conviction.\n\nThe moody camera-work captures the spirit of Gothic horror in every shadowy scene. While the story itself is less than inspired, it does fulfill the promise of a good cobweb chiller right up until the rather predictable ending.\n\nWell worth watching for fans of this genre.",

                "reviewBody": "George C. Scott loses his wife and daughter in a car accident, moves to Seattle, and rents a gigantic old mansion with a haunted secret past.  This film is skillfully directed by Peter Medak who gets more that even he probably bargained from a solid cast of actors, a wonderful script, and one great-looking eerie old house.  Medak creates tons of suspense with the barest sight of blood.  This film reeks atmosphere.  The house reeks atmosphere.  Scott&apos;s performance and that of veteran Melvyn Douglass reek atmosphere.  Doors creak, balls mysteriously bounce, water runs, windows break in the old house trying to tell Scott about the secret of a young child that once lived there.  The script is fanciful yet well-written and very creative.  Scott gives an atypically subdued performance that suggests passion, heartbreak, and tenacity.  The rest of the performers are very good too.  I cannot remember the last time Mr. Douglass gave a poor performance. Some of the scenes that really stand out in my mind are flashback sequences showing the terrible secret that has been hidden in the house for over 70 years.  Medak doesn&apos;t have a huge budget to work with here, but this movie beats out newer haunted house films like the remake of The Haunting by leaps and bounds.  This is one classy scare film!"

                "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a decent movie. I liked very much some cinematographic concepts cleverly used here to build solid tension, and mystery effect. We are used to very straight way of telling very straight stories, but sometimes it&apos;s good to move the camera off the basics a little (even if the story isn&apos;t very original), just to tell something more by the picture, than only what the picture depicts. Mr Bogdanski (DP) and Mr Alvart (DIR) have used some of those &quot;tricks&quot; carefully and wisely, gaining few disturbing shots which actually describe the feel of the whole movie. The story is simple, predictable, and has the &quot;yep, I&apos;ve seen this before&quot; factor, but THOSE few (yes, only few) weird shots puts this movie slightly above the average. And there are Callum Keith Rennie, Kerry O&apos;Malley and Ian McShane who work in the same business here with DP and Director - giving very intense and disturbing appearances in supporting, yet the movie tone establishing roles (especially Rennie not being too demonic). I&apos;m glad that screenplay had provided them few very good sequences to play in.\n\nBut let&apos;s be frank - that&apos;s not enough to break the limits. We have to remember some major flaws: First - the movie is very predictable. Very. Second - Jodelle Ferland plays in a simple, cheap way, using far away easier acting methods, than her character needs. Third - a promise of originality made by DP and Director in the first part of the movie, is never kept because of the second half, where everything is put in WYSIWYG manner, known from shitty Hollywood.\n\nSumming all up - You CAN watch it with a pizza and a beer, but hardly believable that you WILL manage without those. :)",

                "reviewBody": "Stephen King goes to the Twilight Zone in this anthology all connected to a cat who is looking for a distressed girl.\n\nIn fact the first two stories could easily sit alongside Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\n\nDirector Lewis Teague is just the right director for this type of movie. A graduate of Roger Corman&apos;s school of filmmaking and he had done an episode of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\n\nThe first story has James Woods who tries to stop smoking. He visits a company that will make him stop or his loved one will suffer. He demonstrates it by electruciting the floor of a room which the cat is in.\n\nWoods is tempted to smoke knowing he might put his wife in danger. It is blackly humorous and he realises once you stop smoking, do not put on weight.\n\nThe second story involves a casino boss who makes a bet with his wife&apos;s lover, Robert Hays. If Hays manages to walk around the thin ledge of a high rise building he can have his wife, if he does not Hays will be framed for dealing in drugs which has been planted in his car.\n\nAs Hays walks around the ledge the casino boss keeps things interesting by trying to put him off. However Hays gets an opportunity to the turn the tables.\n\nThe final story features Drew Barrymore as the troubled girl calling out to the cat. At night she is pestered by a malevolent troll who tries to steal her breath, the cat arrives to do battle with the troll.\n\nTeague makes reference to other Stephen King adaptations. We see Cujo and Christine make Hitchcock type appearances and even the The Dead Zone is shown playing on television.\n\nThe first two stories are very effective in a twisted humorous way. The final story feels too long and seems more aimed at kids in a Grimm fairytale type of way.",

Any idiot of the street could do it for $10 an hour. Yes, yes, I know the whole &quot;My movies are like a dream&quot; crap, but it&apos;s hard to get absorbed in the dream when you keep being smacked over the head with plot inconsistencies and intensely moronic characters. Credit to Phenomena, Jennifer Connelly made one of the few appealing Argento protagonists, and generally didn&apos;t behave like a complete nitwit (with several exceptions). David Lynch&apos;s movies feel like dreams also, but don&apos;t pull you out of your suspension of disbelief with patent stupidity. If you don&apos;t know Argento, don&apos;t start here. If you&apos;ve never liked Argento, this won&apos;t change your mind. There are some effective moments and nice shots that make the movie not a complete wash, but nothing to really justify it&apos;s existence.",

                "reviewBody": "The sequel to the iconic horror classic Frankenstein is an oddball one. That&apos;s part of its charm. The Bride of Frankenstein sounds like a piece of parody rather than a sincere followup, and in a way it&apos;s awareness of its sometimes satirical nature makes it stronger than its straighter predecessor. However, its finest facets are its ahead-of-its-time technical aspects. The stark cinematography is astonishing and the precision of its sharp editing is unprecedented, let alone the reliably impressive production design. It&apos;s a much more entertaining and enduring experience than other films of the 30s. James Whale got much better conviction out of his actors this time around and it deals with the moral consequences of their actions rather than leaving it to loud anguish. While the film is a bit of retread of the first film as Frankenstein&apos;s monster is chased from place to place, it adds development and essential sensitivity to his character leading its tragic end to be much more meaningful in its destruction. This was a very pleasant surprise, ominously horrific and slyly comic, without the two clashing.\n\n8/10",

                "reviewBody": "I think part of the reason why &apos;The Good Son&apos; is barely remembered is because it deals with a side to humanity that no-one really wants to accept in that not all children are sweet little innocents, pure as the driven snow. It&apos;s not very comfortable watching a film that shows sociopaths-- people born without the ability to feel guilt and empathise with others-- are born, not made and their dangerous traits are apparent even in childhood. &apos;The Good Son&apos; revolves around Mark, a motherless boy of twelve who is sent to stay with his Uncle Wallace, Aunt Susan and two cousins, twelve-year-old Henry and six-year-old Connie. At first, Mark revels in the visit that takes his mind off his recent bereavement but he soon starts to realise that Henry is a sociopath whose parents are blind to his dark, violent side. It is a film that pulls no punches in just how malevolent Henry is and how easily he will pick off anyone who dares to interfere with his twisted sense of fun.\n\nMacaulay Culkin was excellent as the angelic-looking Henry whose boyish cuteness hide his true nature and his performance here proves he could have been one of the few child actors who graduated into a successful young adult actor had his personal life not been such a mess. It really was chilling seeing the child I was so used to seeing in comedies being so emotionally cold. But it is Elijah Wood&apos;s Mark who gives the film heart. Young Wood, only eleven years old when he filmed this, delivered a great performance as a young boy faced with the awful truth and desperate to stop Henry while juggling his grief over losing his mother. The scene where Mark is convinced Henry has poisoned the food is a perfect example of how Wood portrayed Mark&apos;s desperation, hysteria and helplessness in the face of his cousin&apos;s evil.\n\nHowever, one of the flaws of the film is that is a bit choppy, jumping from scene-to-scene without giving you a feel for the other characters, which is a shame because this is one film where you do need to have an understanding of just how Henry&apos;s nature affects all those around him and how he gets away with it all. I read the novelisation of the film by Todd Strasser before seeing the film so it&apos;s all the more noticeable for me. The book not only gives greater insight into Mark&apos;s budding fraternal friendship with Connie and his need to seek a mother in Susan but it also shows Susan&apos;s growing awareness to the monster Henry is and how she feels when she is made to choose between Mark and her murderous child.\n\nOverall, this film is enjoyable enough for a psychological thriller (although a few TV detective shows have done this idea in a slicker way) and it is nice to see a film that doesn&apos;t take a softly-softly attitude when dealing with the matter of children who kill. However, the ending was a bit of a cop-out as there could have been so many other avenues to explore had things ended differently for Henry (what should be done with sociopathic children? How do decent, loving families deal with such a child?). Those who do expect a bit more from their films will probably be disappointed.",

                "reviewBody": "Where are all the protesters who gather whenever some idiot tries to censor artwork or expression that is contrary to American culture? None of them seem to have shown up when this great work was put on the shelf, then later chopped up. Europeans, with an open eye to American society (only due to the benefit of being distant), were able to see this film with honesty. I say this because that&apos;s where it was shown uncut and critically acclaimed.\n\nThe truth is that it is a statement about and against racism, completely misunderstood by the civil rights groups and the others who opposed it. It is a good, hard look at the way racism is propagated in America, through the training of not only this one single dog, but of young people by racist adults and peers as the young people mature into adulthood. It tackles the subject with an honesty that is sadly missing in the statements of most anti-racist organizations.\n\nMost groups prefer to gloss over the true causes of racism with platitudes, and a few often have a political agenda that promotes socialistic ideals, so they really don&apos;t give full attention to the true causes of racism. Everybody now is so afraid of offending anybody else, that everything becomes a watered-down, grayish, inoffensive litany no more bothersome than grouchiness. Sam Fuller stated in film what it really is, and that is that people learn from others throughout childhood, not always by overt indoctrination but by subtle methods, to think in stereotypical and racist terms. Not just whites thinking of blacks as uneducated gangster-rappers, but also those who think of Native Americans as lazy drinkers, Italians as loud-mouthed mob disciples, country folks as hillbilly trailer trash, and so on.\n\nAnd Hollywood does little of significance to dispel this, because they mostly grind things down to these kind of stereotypes to fit into the 2-hr film story mode that they like, which is long on violence, sex and action, and short on character. It&apos;s easier that way. Thanks to Sam Fuller for his courage.\n\nADDENDUM: I had the opportunity to see this again recently after 25 years, and it is still as powerful as I remembered. It does have a B-movie quality to it, a roughness that actually makes it better than if it had been a polished film. The final sequence remains as terrifying as anything I&apos;ve seen in any type of film, horror, suspense, Hitchcock, and so on. And it has a fabulous music score by Ennio Morricone. I&apos;d confidently call this one a must-see!"

It&apos;s not that original, but the way it plays with certain expectations is pretty refreshing, and the whole set up and the way the rampage starts is pretty fantastic. While it never takes on a full-on comedic tone like other horror films, it still takes great pleasure in giving the audience the most simple type of satisfaction. That&apos;s not saying it&apos;s not gory, because it is, and it&apos;s quite brutal. The actors are all pretty appropriate considering the tone of the film, and the twists manage to work. The ending also works in spite of itself. This is highly recommended, perhaps even better than The Conjuring."

                "name": "#WalrusYes -- Kevin Smith Has Gone Insane (and it&apos;s Wicked Fun)",
                "reviewBody": "I am biased in the realm of Kevin Smith movies so, for the record, my thoughts on TUSK are probably going to be a little more forgiving that what I believe is the general consensus (this movie gotten beaten down on Rotten Tomatoes). I&apos;ve been a fan of Kevin Smith for years and I know I&apos;ll always give his movies a chance. Since the completion of his Jersey series (the Jay/Silent Bob era), his movies have certainly been hit and miss. None have been able to recapture the same level of fun but many have come close. TUSK is one of them. I love the Smith has reached a point where he&apos;s not trying to reach general audiences, opting instead to make movies for his existing fans. He&apos;s not afraid to go wild with a bizarre idea if it sounds like it could be fun. TUSK is the first film in what will be a trilogy of films set in Canada and opens with our introduction to Wallace Bryton (Justin Long). Wallace is a podcaster with his best friend Teddy (Haley Joel Osment), living a successful life of producing his zany web show and failing to be faithful to his beautiful long-time girlfriend Ally (Genesis Rodriguez). He sets off alone into a remote area of Manitoba for an interview bit and finds a story in the mysterious Howard Howe (Michael Parks). Howard has lived a life of adventure and wishes to share his tale of sailing the sea, meeting Ernest Hemingway, and forming a friendship with a walrus on a deserted island\u0085.\n\nTUSK is a horror/comedy but it really struggles to fully function in either capacity. It finds a decent balance and I thought it was a weird, fun movie but it&apos;s never all that scary or funny enough. This isn&apos;t much of an issue for me because the movie&apos;s insane premise keeps it interesting and the performances, particularly Michael Parks, are so well done. The biggest problem with TUSK is actually the main character, Wallace. Not the performance; Justin Long does an awesome job. The actual character. Wallace is thoroughly unlikable. He&apos;s dismissive of his girlfriend and early scenes show how little he cares about her outside the bedroom. He proudly brags about his infidelities to his best friend/fellow podcaster Teddy, and he&apos;s got no moral qualms with taking advantage of others for the sake of producing his show. He&apos;s crude, self- centered, and arrogant and, when he finds himself in a horrifying situation, I had zero sympathy for him. Go ahead, Mr. Howe. Wallace deserves it; he already lacks any humanity. So right there, the movie is lacking suspense because I don&apos;t care what happens to our protagonist. I care more about Ally and Teddy who, despite how much of a jerk Wallace is, still rush off to Canada to find him when they learn he&apos;s in trouble. The real star (and most people seem to agree) is Michael Parks. His raving zealot character in Smith&apos;s RED STATE has got nothing on Howard Howe. He gets to go full- blown lunatic in TUSK. He starts off seemingly harmless: an old man in an electric wheelchair with a flair for elegant (if awkward) speech and a desire to share his stories with an interested party. But soon he drops the pretense, reveals his true self, and goes off the chain. It&apos;s almost hilarious but you know, if you were trapped alone with this man in the middle of nowhere, you were be scared out of your mind.\n\nWhat I enjoy most about TUSK is that it was done on a super-low budget and has to get creative as a result. That means practical effects. No CG. Any film using practical makeup FX is going to earn bonus points with me. We all know what&apos;s coming from the start of the movie and we&apos;re waiting anxiously for it. When the suit finally makes its appearance halfway through the film, it does not disappoint. Of course it&apos;s going to look fake. I don&apos;t care about that. It&apos;s a physical prop with presence and weight, it&apos;s hideous, it&apos;s a little funny, and it works 100% for me. The suit comes out. The walrus training begins. Things get weird. Meanwhile, Ally and Teddy are on the case and, for a while, their story is the more interesting one. Their adventure in Canada to investigate Wallace&apos;s disappearance leads them to an encounter late in the film with the film&apos;s second strangest character Guy Lapointe. I hated the character the first time I watched TUSK, thinking him too goofy for the film, but he&apos;d grown on me by the second viewing. A former police investigator who&apos;s gone solo in his investigation of the weird series of missing persons in Manitoba, he&apos;s a surprise cameo (if you&apos;ve managed to avoid spoilers) that is going to play a larger role in the second film of Smith&apos;s Canada film trilogy. I&apos;m annoyed that he shows up so late in the game and it feels like it leads to a rushed conclusion to end the film. The first hour or so of the movie is very slowly paced and then it all gets wrapped up in a quickie of a climax at the finish.\n\nTUSK is a movie for Kevin Smith fans and I&apos;m sure not all of them are going to dig it. It&apos;s a movie for people with a taste for the weird. It&apos;s got good (some great) performances, awesomely disturbing makeup FX, and Smith&apos;s unique style of writing running through it. Smith fans will probably have already sought this movie out, but I recommend others give it a shot as well.",

I would say it is probably a good film but something I cannot say I enjoyed watching, which was probably the aim of the director. Taboo subjects in society change rapidly over the years and this film deals with argumentibly the most taboo, certainly a topic most people find hard to talk about. Abuse and torture happen. Fact. What this film managed to do for me is to take both subjects and ram them down my throat at a more than uncomfortable rate. And that is the story line. No humour. No romance as such and no happiness. For me this was not entertainment. I guess some people will enjoy this film, in the same way that people like to rubber neck at accidents when they drive past. The publicity will make this film popular and it will no doubt develop a form of notoriety that clockwork orange and the exorcist enjoyed twenty years ago. But for me. I will not be watching it again as I would not be able to get anything positive out of it.",

                "reviewBody": "Tesis is a film about a film student writing an assignment on violence on film, which is appropriate because Tesis is itself, an assignment written by Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar on violence and the state of the Spanish film industry. Amen\u00e1bar has packed the film with nods towards the industry, and the reasons why it isn&apos;t working and this ties in excellently with the central theme of violence. The director professes that Spain&apos;s film industry will not be a success until it gives the people what it wants - and that theory in it&apos;s purest form is snuff films. Snuff films don&apos;t have any production values and exist purely to please their audience on an aesthetic level - and the snuff industry in this film is in a boom period! The idea of violence and why we find it is fascinating has made the base for many films, and it serves this one excellently too. The scene at the start sums all up; we open in a train station where someone has committed suicide. The station guards are trying to ensure that nobody sees the horror, and yet there&apos;s scores of people surrounding the tracks and Amen\u00e1bar makes sure that even you - the viewer - want to survey the horror for yourself.\n\nI don&apos;t know how successful Tesis was in it&apos;s native Spain, but it&apos;s certainly one of the best films to come out of the country in recent memory, and a lot of the reason for that is that the director has heeded his own advice and given the audience what they want. Rather than try and be deep and complex like many other foreign films, Tesis is a straight thriller, not unlike what would come out of America&apos;s thriving industry, and the fact that Amen\u00e1bar has knowingly accepted what his film is and hasn&apos;t tried to make it any more than that does it no end of favours. The film follows a relaxed pace, and the basic structure follows a mystery, which is being unravelled by two students; Angela, the one doing the thesis and Chema; someone she met because of his infamous love for violent films. The way that Amen\u00e1bar keeps the film flowing steadily ensures that we are really able to get into the mystery, and this makes the film far more thrilling overall. The film is about snuff films, but it shouldn&apos;t be mistaken for one itself. The focus is often kept away from violence, and the director only shows us just enough of the snuff to whet our appetites.\n\nThe film&apos;s main point is to show us the mystery, but the characters are never made to take a backseat. The two central figures are given time to grow as people so that we can really get to know them, and even feel for them. In many thrillers, the characters and the mystery can&apos;t be weighed up evenly; but despite the fact that he&apos;s only a young filmmaker, Amen\u00e1bar has shown his brilliance by doing it to perfection. The characters actually compliment the mystery, in fact, because at times it flows because of who the characters are. This really allows the film to become compelling, and this is also where most of the true greatness lies. The characters are brought to life by a great cast of young actors. The beautiful Ana Torrent takes the lead role, and is joined by d\u00e9butant Fele Mart\u00ednez, who plays her opposite number. These two have an awkward chemistry, and this is capitalised on brilliantly. The third lead is played by Eduardo Noriega, who would go on to make a splash in Amen\u00e1bar&apos;s Open Your Eyes a year later.\n\nTesis doesn&apos;t get mentioned all that often in discussions about great horror/thrillers - and I really have no idea why. This is a first rate film, and really shows its cast and director&apos;s talent. The Spanish film industry may be on the decline - but it wont be if they can pump out a few more films like this one!",

He has his hands full dealing with the recently returned and the undead love of his life.\n\nWords can not do justice to the magic of this movie or the impression it leaves.\n\nIf you believe in the magic of cinema and are willing to embrace fantasy in its purest form, open yourself up to DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE."

In some scenes the emotional reactions of the characters to certain events seem almost non-existent while others are very trashy (e.g. The woman who stares terrified a zombie but stays where she is and doesn&apos;t even attempt to escape, or the four people who are in a wood full of zombies but decide to split into couples). In many scenes, however, there is a lot of scary atmosphere and in others a little bit less; some shot are amazing and have a very good photography, some others not; all in all the plot is very good and the gory style of Fulci is stunning and result of a very creative mind. I think you won&apos;t regret to watch it, it&apos;s totally worth.",

Satires are only appreciated by a certain audience. If you didn&apos;t like &quot;Heathers&quot;, &quot;Scream&quot; or &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, then don&apos;t bother watching this unless sci-fi comedies is your thing. This isn&apos;t just a comedy, it is shocking and has great twists and thrills along the ride. At times it is down right scary. Even sexy (nudity)! It is all around entertaining with some pretty good acting. My personal favorite is the couple that is always fighting, watch out for them! If you loved at least one of the FOUR film versions of &quot;Invasion of The Body Snatchers&quot; then you will truly enjoy the satire of this film, and how much it truly honors previous classics in the way that &quot;Scream&quot; did. Now some say this film is for Teenagers who don&apos;t know any better than to think this is a great sci-fi film, but the biggest fan of this film that I know is my 63 year old mother, and I am surely not a teenager anymore.\n\nThis film is a classic, and yes, it does feature teenagers as the main cast (not the actors.) But the adult characters make a great performance, and even Jon Stewart is pretty entertaining as the science teacher.\n\nOne film that you should stay for the cast credits just for Jon&apos;s appearance!",

If it weren&apos;t for Joel Edgerton I would have shut this down 1/3 of the way in. It was confusing, incongruent and frankly a little boring. I patiently waited though and saw it through. Alas the climax was so disappointing I was in shock... and it didn&apos;t even happen at night!!! What the hell was coming at night??? Nothing came... even during the day. Not cool... not a horror film, barely a thriller, just a shame.",

                "reviewBody": "Carla Moran is violently raped by a seemingly invisible force. She tried to tell the people around her about what has happened but finds only resistance as her family and friends don&apos;t believe her as she didn&apos;t see who assaulted her especially when she says that her house was locked up when it happened and the assailant seemingly vanished into thin air.\n\nFrank De Felitta&apos;s bestselling book based on a true story (the case of Doris Bither) translates very well to the big screen with Barbara Hershey cast as Carla doing a phenomenal job in invoking the terror of a woman going through something very real but undertaken by someone or something very unreal. Apparently Bette Midler, Sally Field, Jane Fonda and Jill Clayburgh were all offered the role but declined.\n\nSidney J. Furie&apos;s film stands alone as a one-off film of a one-off case that most people will have thought of as too much of a tall story to be true.\n\nCarla not being believed can also be seen as an allegory of something that far too many women (and men) go through when they find the courage and strength to report a rape or sexual assault- that their horror isn&apos;t over yet as they try to seek justice whilst being met with an unfeeling and cruel judicial system that views their account with scepticism and disbelief. If it actually makes it to a court of law they will be made to relive their trauma. Those opposing them will try to disprove and belittle the magnitude of what they&apos;ve been through. Or they will try to convince a jury that it didn&apos;t happen at all.\n\nThe film all too harrowingly shows the full horror of what Carla goes through when she is raped and does a great job of showing the trail of very disturbing signs when the spirit or entity is approaching (objects shaking, a certain odour that permeates the surroundings Moran is in, a very sudden drop in temperature). Hershey&apos;s performance, just like the film in general, never slides into TV movie melodramatics or sensationalism.\n\nThere needs to be special mention to Charles Bernstein&apos;s insistent, pulsating and truly shocking score that is perfect for the movie and it&apos;s subject matter. There are also echoes of the music he would write three years later for a new film called A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nAlso the special effects for the scenes in which Moran is molested by the invisible force are very effective indeed. For one sequence a body cast of Hershey was made that was manipulated by currents of air to make it look like the invisible entity was touching her. It succeeds eerily well. Stan Winston supervised the practical effects.\n\nThe effects also come into their own when Carla meets professionals who actually believe her story and work in the field of parapsychology. But to tell you more about this would make me tiptoe into spoiler territory...\n\nWhen the film opened it was met with protests from those who thought that such a film was exploiting such a serious topic as rape. Hershey actually defended this claim and voiced that herself and the filmmakers had actually worked hard not to make the film exploitative and to display the true horror of sexual assault and rape.\n\nAll in all a terrifying film that still feels underrated and excluded from serious writings regarding 80&apos;s horror.",

                "reviewBody": "Depression surrounds poor Louise as she battles taking care of her abusive father who holds some sinister secrets in The Attic.\n\nLouise is a very sad and lonely person who was stood up at the altar by the love of her love. almost 20 years ago, something she has not been able to get past. In the midst of her depression involving that, she is also being forced into retirement at the library she works in and is being replaced by a &quot;younger model&quot;. On top of ALL of this, she has to take care of her tyrannical wheelchair-bound father who verbally abuses her at every turn. He attacks her appearance, the way she speaks, the job she has, etc.\n\nThroughout the film, we see Louise fantasizing of killing her father in different ways. She also starts obsessing over the young person replacing her at the library named Emily. Emily has it all. Youth, a new position at the library, and a fiancee she is madly in love with. When a younger guy shows interest in Louise, things start to take a positive turn for her and her passive ways. But it isn&apos;t long before her father makes things worse for her and reveals some dark secrets of his own. All this leads to Louise breaking down further and a satisfying ending.\n\nThe compelling thing about this movie is the character of Louise. It is her mental health and overwhelming sadness that drew my attention throughout and kept me interested to see where it was going. I think we can all relate to a time when things weren&apos;t going well for us in our lives, and her general depressed mood definitely made me feel for her. Carrie Snodgress delivers a very emotional and powerful performance as Louise, the lonely and timid librarian who seems to have a dark cloud constantly hanging over her head.\n\nThe Attic is a very effective horror film. Extremely slow moving at times, but I never lost interest in following Louise&apos;s journey. It&apos;s only available on VHS at this point making it virtually impossible to find, but if you get the chance it is a recommended watch for sure!\n\n7/10",

                "reviewBody": "The Vestron Video version of this film appears to be uncut (it&apos;s hard to imagine what might be missing). Truly, though, the creepiest part of it is the one woman&apos;s so-called &quot;son&quot;, Michael, who is OBVIOUSLY not a child but, in fact, some kind of &apos;little person&apos;. Why the producers of the film decided to cast an actor who is clearly an adult as a child is beyond me, but it certainly ups the &quot;ewwww!&quot; factor in several scenes. Most notably is that following one of the (many) zombie attacks when Michael goes to his mother for comfort and then starts nuzzling her breasts and reaching up her dress. I&apos;m not sure if this would have actually been creepier if the actor had actually been a child, but it is far more disturbing than any of the gore on display. The rest of the film is alright. I actually liked the fact that very little time was wasted on explanations on the source of the zombie-ism (eccentric professor raises the dead and then is eaten by them - &quot;No, stop - I&apos;m your friend!&quot;), that they pretty quickly get down to the business of gut-munching and flesh-ripping. Any normal viewer will either despise or at least feel indifferent toward all of the non-zombie characters; we are aren&apos;t in any way asked or persuaded to identify or sympathize with anyone here, so (like all of the &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; movies and most slasher flicks) you end up hating all of the victims and cheering on the zombies, taking great satisfaction when they get their intestines pulled out or heads cut off. It doesn&apos;t help matters that all the living humans behave, almost without exception, in a fashion that can at best be generously called moronic (no offense intended toward any of you morons out there) - which only makes you want to see them all die that much more. One complaint: the video transfer of this film is rather on the darkish side, which makes some of the best scenes (especially those at night) difficult to fully appreciate (most notably the maid&apos;s crucifixion/decapitation). There are better zombie movies, definitely, but you can also do a lot worse."

                "reviewBody": "Part psychological thriller, part sci-fi, part ALIENS, PANDORUM is a unique hybrid. Although nothing new in terms of things we haven&apos;t seen before (encapsulate a group of men/women and see how they react), the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what&apos;s around the next corner.\n\nThe story is pretty common: Earth is doomed. Spaceships are sent out to find a habitable planet. One of these ships has been lost in space for some time, and when ship&apos;s pilot #4, Bower (Ben Foster, 3:10 TO YUMA), wakes up from a prolonged hyper-sleep, much of his memory is gone or scrambled. Slowly things begin coming into focus as he finds various clues about who and where he&apos;s at. And not long after his awakening, another pod opens up and spills out Payton (Dennis Quaid, VANTAGE POINT), a high ranking officer who&apos;s memory is just as screwed up.\n\nBower is chosen to explore the ship, and getting out of their pod chamber is the first challenge since they&apos;re locked in for unknown reasons. Like giving birth, Bower squeezes through the canals of the ship&apos;s innards and is expelled onto what appears to be a dead ship. But he quickly runs into friends and foes. Some of the crew, it appears, have mutated and are cannibalistic. Others have had to do terrible things in order to fight and survive. All Bower wants to do is reactivate the ship&apos;s power systems and get to the bridge.\n\nAnd that&apos;s about as far as I want to go without producing any spoilers....\n\nThere are several &quot;jump-in-your-seat&quot; moments that&apos;ll surprise the hell out of most viewers. And the darkness of the cold ship makes for some excellent atmosphere. The sound score also added a spooky quality to the production.\n\nBen Foster has rarely let me down in his choice of roles, and Pandorum was no exception. His embattled and continually challenged character was pitched just right throughout the film. It was also one of the first times I&apos;d seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He&apos;s a great young actor.\n\nAnd I&apos;ve saved the best for last: the filming. It was pretty amazing. Again, the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived (something I can&apos;t say of all films ...like THE DESCENT).\n\nSurprisingly this film got poor reviews and pretty much flopped at the box office (costing over $40 million to make but only grossing $10 million). Shame. It&apos;s actually better than you might think.",

                "reviewBody": "A great anthology film in the Amicus tradition. Five men find themselves going down an elevator into a huge room(looking like a giant boardroom) where they seem to be expected.  Each one has a fear that continually seems to plague him and they relate their fears to each other.  The opening lacks the production values and Sir Ralph Richardson of its predecessor Tales From the Crypt as the crypt-keeper sorely, but the stories are all well-done with finesse from cast, crew, and the very able direction of an underappreciated Roy Ward Baker.  The first story is about vampires in a small English town, and it is a very tasty vignette.  The second story, starring Glynis Johns and Terry-Thomas(both funny beyond belief), is the comedic relief of the film about a man who is too neat who needs to have that point hammered into his head by his wife.   For him it is definitely a jarring experience.  The third story is about a magician and his wife that kill to acquire a magic trick.  Curt Jurgens is very good as the evil magician.  A good story.  The fourth story is easily the weakest about a man buried alive for insurance. Lastly, the most literate of the stories concerns Dr. Who&apos;s Tom Baker seeking revenge on those that have profited on his artwork behind his back. He gets revenge through voodoo.  All in all a great deal of fun.  As previously stated, be sure to get the uncut version."

                "reviewBody": "This movie is about, of course, a girl who can start fires with her mind. Through a series of flashbacks we see how she came about these powers and why the government is now pursuing her.  This movie features a few stars such as the title character Drew Barrymore, David Keith, George C. Scott, and Martin Sheen.  Keith plays Barrymore&apos;s dad and he also has special abilities mainly consisting of a strange ability to control a persons mind. Through the first half of the film we see these two chased by this organization called &quot;the shop&quot; which is actually referred too in a couple of other King novels (never read this one though).  The second half has them captured by this organization and performing tests on Barrymore&apos;s character. For the most part this movie is very slow moving and a bit confusing.  I have watched it a few times and I still am unsure of George C Scott&apos;s motivations.  You see Charlie (Barrymore) use her powers here and there, but nothing to grand, that is until the end where the movie really ends with a bang.",

                "reviewBody": "Martin, a law student, works as a night watchman in the morgue of a hospital. The morgue is a scary setting. When gruesome incidents occur there again and again, Martin gets involved in a bloody criminal case about a brutally murdering serial killer who has it in for pretty young women. Horror, crime, thriller and, not to be guessed from the description so far, humour as well. With his debut film, Danish director Ole Bornedal succeeded in creating a gripping, atmospherically dense thriller with many shocker elements. The viewer can place himself exactly in the eerie world around the protogonist and is constantly led on false trails. Besides holding your breath a few times, the work impresses with a strong pinch of black humour. There is also nothing to complain about in terms of acting, especially Kim Bodnia can put herself in the limelight brilliantly, as always. Perhaps the visuals of the film are not quite &quot;glossy&quot;, but you can see from the remake 3 years later that this is not the decisive essence of a good scary thriller. Definitely a small genre pearl.",

                "reviewBody": "In Bangkok, after celebrating a drinking party with his closest friends, the photographer Tun (Ananda Everingham) and his girlfriend Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) have a car accident on the road, with Jane hitting a girl. Tun does not allow her to help the girl and they ran away leaving the girl lying on the road. When Tun reveals his latest pictures, he finds some mysterious shadows, while the couple is systematically haunted by the ghost of the girl. Tun investigates and finds that the victim was his former shy and weird girlfriend Natre (Achita Sikamana), who studied with him in the college. Later Jane discloses deep and hidden secrets about the relationship of Natre, Tun and his friends.\n\n&quot;Shutter&quot; is a creepy and a very, but really very scary horror movie. The story is very well developed, in an excellent pace, with a twist to an unexpected direction and with a great and consistent conclusion. The cinematography intensely explores the red and some black and white very well and the effects are simple but stunning. There is an interesting Message Board, where an IMDb User brilliantly asked: &quot;What is your scariest moment?&quot; It is amazing to read the number of different scenes selected by the users. My favorite scene is when Tun is in the black room revealing a photo, Jane arrives and the phone rings. These samples show that the film offers many frightening moments. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Esp\u00edritos, A Morte Est\u00e1 Ao Seu Lado&quot; (&quot;Spirit, Death is At Your Side&quot;)",

                "reviewBody": "This film seems to me to lack balance between the combination of elements that it blends together: the thriller-suspense factor, the gore, and the &quot;surprise&quot; factor. It is a very irregular film, but it still boasts good style and good manners in atmosphere-building, even if it doesn&apos;t really live up to meet the expectations, at least for me.\n\nThe story goes about Marie and Alexia, best friends who drive up to Alexia&apos;s parents&apos; countryside house, hoping to find some peace for studying. Instead, they&apos;ll have to fight a psychopathic killer in a macabre cat-and-mouse game.\n\nThe best part, in my opinion, is the mise-en-scene and the introduction of the characters and the storyline. Everything in those first sequences tells us that something horrible is going to happen, not only because we already know that we&apos;re watching a horror film. The dusty road, the scorching weather, the big corn fields... the real feel of a horror story scene is there. It increases with the night scenes, the shots of the house, the staircase, the corridors. The gloominess and inherent darkness of the place and the quiet surroundings perfectly do their job of preparing us for what&apos;s to come.\n\nThe story-telling loses steam after this part. Not being a big fan of gore, I didn&apos;t really care for the bloody murder scenes, but I&apos;m sure that they&apos;ll be appreciated by many -they&apos;re rather truculent and well filmed. The duel between Marie and the killer didn&apos;t really work for me; in fact, I found it a little boring. On the whole, I thought the story was unoriginal and predictable, but, contrary to what many say, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s deceitful -I didn&apos;t feel that the director cheats on the audience with the ending. (I won&apos;t elaborate on this so as not to spoil the film for those who want to see it).\n\nI have mixed feelings about &quot;High Tension&quot;. On the one hand, for me, it is ineffective as a thriller, and flawed as an exercise of story-telling. On the other, however, the murky atmosphere and the darkness of the story and of its subtleties stuck with me for a while after seeing the film. I wouldn&apos;t watch it again, but I understand why many like it so much."

He believes that man is an animal that thinks too much, and he develops a parasite to increase the violence and sexual desire of mankind. There is an outbreak in the condominium, with the fierce dwellers becoming zombies of sex.\n\n&quot;Shivers&quot; is the third feature of this great Canadian cult director David Cronenberg, indeed a very low budget trash movie, with a final cost of US$ 179.000,00. The story mixes humor and horror and the effects are very nasty and disgusting, a trademark of Cronenberg. The story is a kind of sexual version of &quot;The Night of the Living Dead&quot;, with people turning out zombies of sex. The screenplay of 1979 &quot;Alien&quot; used many concepts of this movie. The interview of David Cronenberg in the DVD is excellent, and it is very funny to know that the actress Sue Patrick asked him to slap her face in the scenes that she needed to cry, and Barbara Steele reaction to this physical assault. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Calafrios&quot; (&quot;Shivers&quot;)",

                "reviewBody": "Now this I would call exactly an average film. For me, it landed precisely at the very center of imdb&apos;s 10 point scale, right at 5.5. This means that I found exactly as much to like as I did to dislike. There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that&apos;s stolen from other better horror movies. If it had opted for tone and real fear instead of cheap shocks, the movie could have been great. The story is good enough that it could have been great if handled well. But we do live in these times, and, although there are scholars of the modern era who would try to have us believe that the current generation consists of a bunch of kids who get everything instantly and process it on a billion levels at once, the truth is indeed the exact opposite. No, there is no subtlety here. It would go over your average teenager&apos;s head in a heartbeat. Nope, better play it safe and provide us with a gruesome scene up front where a couple of dozen people are sliced in half by a loose cable during a ball. Gore is not scary. I did however produce a dry heave during this sequence, which is more than I can say for any other gore scene that I&apos;ve viewed lately. As the gore accumulates, I began to appreciate the artistry that was put into the enormous number of deaths. These are some sickeningly creative people, let me tell you. Unfortunately, the director (or screenwriters or whoever) ruins any real potential by revealing every detail about what happened on the titular boat in a fast-motion sequence accompanied by techno music! It&apos;s the kind of moment where you just slap your head for the lack of talent involved. And then there was more stuff I liked. For example, the art direction is very impressive. The revelation of one character&apos;s identity, while not particularly surprising, is at least somewhat new. I give this film a 5/10, rounding down because I felt the final moment was a bit groan-inducing.",

                "reviewBody": "A potential serial killer and his kidnap victim... can they develop a relationship, a rapport? This is what viewers will be left wondering after the socially inept kidnapper is forced to take care of his victim, including buying her feminine hygiene products.\n\nThe film starts out with some of the most awful shaky cam I&apos;ve ever seen. If the viewer is prone to motion sickness, this may be a bit unbearable for them... I&apos;m not overly susceptible, but another five minutes and this film would have been ejected. Luckily, it stops after the introduction.\n\nAnd once the shaky cam goes away, we realize something that makes or breaks an independent film. In this case, it makes it: a good story. Thanks, Christopher Nelson. Sure, I&apos;ve read multiple reviews saying this film covers familiar ground. And they&apos;re right. There&apos;s nothing particularly unique about a kidnapper and his victim. We could use a twist -- like a female kidnapper and a male victim. But as far as this archetype is concerned, I think they executed it well.\n\nAbout the acting... the lead actor (James DuMont) is a bit silly, but fit the quirkiness of the role. The lead actress (Michelle Tomlinson) is solid. I don&apos;t think she stands out, I don&apos;t think this will launch her career... but she did well.\n\nThe quotations on the box are a bit weak --do you really need multiple quotes from my friends at Pretty Scary? -- but the movie was good. If you&apos;re a supporter of independent film, this certainly is worth your time. Not the most polished, not the greatest film of the year... but it held my attention and the attention of my friend Seth, which is more than we can say for most films when we&apos;re drunk off our butts.",

                "reviewBody": "For some reason there is just something oddly entertaining about &quot;Maniac Cop&quot;. And I do believe it is based on the fact that I used to have this movie on VHS back in the day when it was released, and I do have fond memories of it being a fairly good movie back then.\n\nThen I got a chance to revisit Matt Cordell and the rest of the people in &quot;Maniac Cop&quot; in 2017. And my fond memories of the movie were slowly starting to vaporize into mist. The movie is quite campy and cheesy actually, and it really had that late 1980&apos;s and early 1990&apos;s horror movie feel to it.\n\nThe story in &quot;Maniac Cop&quot; is quite straight forward and very easy to keep up with. A deranged killer is stalking the innocent people on the streets of New York. And as the death toll rise, police officer Jack Forrest finds himself arrested for a murder he didn&apos;t commit. Determined to bring the real perpetrator to justice, Jack seeks out to track down the killer.\n\n&quot;Maniac Cop&quot; is labeled as an action/crime/horror, so it spans over a wide array of genres with very different contents. And to some extend it does deliver on these accounts. The action, well it was there, just don&apos;t expect it to be anything grand or jaw-dropping. The crime, well that was actually the focal point of the movie. The horror, again not overwhelmingly a factor for the movie. It wasn&apos;t even scary back in 1988.\n\nThis movie actually has some interesting enough actors and actresses on the cast list. Most memorable for me was Bruce Campbell, of course, and it is still a wonderful treat to watch him in this movie. However, it should be said that Tom Atkins was also good in this movie, and he is one of those faces that you instantly recognize and remember from that era. And then there is also Robert Z&apos;Dar who brought life to Matt Cordell, and he was nicely cast for the role.\n\nAll in all, then &quot;Maniac Cop&quot; is a mediocre movie, but still proves to be entertaining and watchable given how cheesy and campy it actually is. And true to the horror movies of the late 1980&apos;s, the ending was just quite predictable, and of course laid grounds for a potential sequel.\n\n&quot;Maniac Cop&quot; is not an overly impressive movie if you sit down to watch it today and compare it to the movies readily available and released today, especially so if you weren&apos;t already familiar with the movie from back in the day.",

I&apos;m a great fan of Lynch&apos;s Wild at Heart having seen it four times, and recently loved Lost Highway. But this one left me baffled. I&apos;d heard of it for years, but can make little sense of it. It certainly didn&apos;t bore me, in fact I was fascinated to see where the plot led. Tried to analyse it in terms of symbolism, but decided that if I have to do that the film isn&apos;t really speaking to me. The dark broodiness is impressive, the squishiness repulsive, and Henry&apos;s hairdo is unforgettable!"

Immediately for the majority of the whole hour of the hour and a half film. It&apos;s just build-up to the prom there are long scenes with the killer is just calling up all his victims and just threatening trying to scare them.it overstays its welcome it just drags the movie out. Along with Jamie Lee Curtis, none of the other characters are really that interesting or we get to know anything about them throughout the whole movie it&apos;s just them talking and goofing around. By the hour mark is where it starts to get interesting because that&apos;s when the prom actually happens with the killer pursuing his victims but more generic and clich\u00e9 with teenagers just making dumb decisions there&apos;s a scene with one girl just runs further away for the auditorium where all the students are dancing and just runs to the far end of the school where no one would even know she was here. This entire film they constantly hammer and the possibility of suspects who the killer might be. The ending is disappointing and Lazy. The most recognizable scene in this movie is the dance with the Prom night song playing. This movie could&apos;ve been cut down to a short film instead of feature-length.",

                "reviewBody": "In the beginning of the times, God created life into universe: light gave birth to angels, earth to men and fire to djin, creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. One who wakes a djin shall be given three wishes. Upon granting the third, an unholy legion of djins are freed through a doorway between the worlds upon the Earth. In 1127 A.D., in Persia, a sorcerer lures and traps a powerful Djinn (Andrew Divoff) in the stone of secret fire. In the present days, a drunken crane operator drops the valuable statue of Ahura Mazda over the assistant of Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund) on the harbor, and one worker finds the huge and priceless opal red stone where Djin is seized. Alexandra Amberson (Tammy Lauren), who works in an auction house, receives the stone for evaluation and accidentally awakes Djin. The evil creature is released later, charges the stone with people souls and feeds with their fears, while chasing Alexandra to force to make three wishes and unleash the demoniac fiends upon Earth.\n\nThe gore and funny &quot;Wishmaster&quot; is good horror movie, with original deaths, great special effects (1997) and a refreshing story. Andrew Divoff, presently working in &quot;Lost&quot;, is great in the role of the evil, witty and cynical Djin; the blonde Tammy Lauren performs a smart and clever character, following the Djin&apos;s advice (&quot;- Make a wish, but think first&quot;) and luring and tricking the demon with her intelligence; and there is homage to horrors movie, with the participation of Robert &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; Englund and Tony &quot;Candyman&quot; Todd. I have watched this film at least four times along ten years and it is still one of my favorites in the genre. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;O Mestre dos Desejos&quot; (&quot;The Master of the Wishes&quot;)",

                "reviewBody": "When the trailer boasted the producers of &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot; and &quot;Insidious&quot; the idea of what tone this film would be reared it&apos;s head. Based around a series of jump scare sequences and slow character sections in order to attempt to make you feel for the characters while easing the tension of the situation. It&apos;s a tired formula that is becoming all the more clich\u00e9d and repetitive. However Sinister manages to find ways to break free of these leashes that the horror genre is becoming tied down to.\n\nEthan Hawk stars as a true crime writer known as Ellison who moves into a new home with his wife, Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and his two children, Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D&apos;Addario) near the site of a local crime in order to get inspiration for his novel. During an exploration of the house Ellison stumbles across a box with an 8mm camera and a selection of films, which upon viewing exploit gruesome murders. This thrusts area hero into a terrifying mystery as he tries to piece together the meaning behind it all.\n\nWith horror films these days we come to know what to expect. We&apos;re given characters that we can&apos;t connect with merely there to service the plot and an un-original story that we&apos;ve seen time and time again bringing the audience no sense of engagement. But mostly we&apos;re never scared beyond the mere technique of a jump scare. With director Scott Derrickson we are shown again how mainstream horror can creep on us with effective imagery and suggestion. The scares here can be portrayed by just using obscure camera angles and bizarre images that unsettle us. Derrickson understands though that using loud bands and noises to jolt the audience can be done effectively. By backing up these moments with his strong imagery he uses it as a tactic to implant these horrific moments in our minds.\n\nThe highlight however is the use of the 8mm films. Sinister is in love with the idea of film, from celluloid to digital as not only are we treated to disturbing super 8 films but Ellison boasts are large collection of VHS tapes of his old achievements. It&apos;s a nice, simple touch that film fans will appreciate. These 8mm films though boast some truly graphic sequences, one particularly involving a garden tool. Backed with a moody soundtrack by Christopher Young who&apos;s worked on other horror gems such as &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot;. It feels more of an ambiance piece rather than a fully diegetic score merging together a series of dark and effective sounds building the feeling of dread constantly throughout.\n\nWritten by Derrickson himself and writer C. Robert Cargill the screenplay manages for the most part to push past the bland formula we&apos;ve grown to endure with horror films of late. The film brings an intriguing plot that manages to put you in the position of Ellison&apos;s character, uncovering the plot and mystery when he does. There are scenes in which are hero re-visits the 8mm films and discovers new elements to them which adds a new depth to the story. The film feels relentless, rarely taking time to slow down and constantly feeling as though it&apos;s propelling towards something. However elements of the script are where the weaker parts of the film shine. While managing to bring interesting uses of horror and tension the film often retreads over clich\u00e9d ground as though it&apos;s trying to keep a warm attitude towards mainstream audiences. These are the times when the film feels as though it may lose focus but always manages to pick up its feet again. Alongside this we have some underused side and poorly written characters such as a police deputy who doesn&apos;t feel natural within the whole scale of things.\n\nSinister may tread over worn ground by it still manages to feel fresh and revitalizing in an age where we&apos;ve conformed to the degrading standards of horror. It embraces the roots of horror and film in general making it much more than a homage and a feeling of an original yet genuinely terrifying story. Hawk manages to carry the emotional tangent of the narrative while the other characters are merely serviceable. It&apos;s not groundbreaking but for a mainstream horror film it takes some inventive and daring steps creating a terrifying, disturbing yet absorbing piece of cinema.\n\n4/5 Stars.",

                "reviewBody": "I have watched both Twilight and Let the Right one in.\n\nI strongly feel that Let the Right outruns Twilight on almost EVERY SINGLE ASPECT, except, of course, advertisement, due to the inequality of budgets. (a Swedish director vs a Hollywood one, come on...) If Twilight is no more than an idol gallery under the skin of vampire horror, Let the Right one in is such a film that completely redefines people&apos;s perception on traditional vampire horrors.\n\nThere aren&apos;t many gory scenes or special visual impacts, unlike Twilight being fraught with computer generated scenes. Plus, the pace of Let the Right is slow, without many exaggerations. Yet, the audience could feel the profound impact of the film within, an impact that totally transcends cheap sensory stimuli, while exerting a quiet yet POWERFUL &quot;shake&quot; upon people&apos;s soul.\n\nI felt very upset that an American remake will be done next year. From our common sense, we could deduct how the remake would be compared to the original. Before the remake ruins the story, do yourself a favour watching the originals!!!\n\nIf you feel yourself mentally more mature than 15 y.o., go watch Let the Right on in instead of Twilight. You will NOT regret your choice.",

It is a good horror film overall.\n\nTerry O&apos;Quinn is fantastic as Jerry Blake - his performance is amazing. He &quot;MADE&quot; this film - and made it scary. This one rates fairly high on my personal scare factor scale. The character Jerry Blake is one twisted, cunning, evil and vile man. This guy is definitely off his rocker - not a man you would ever want to be around.\n\nThe story is not all that bad, interesting, but this film is worth watching for Terry O&apos;Quinn alone. The rest of the cast is good as well. Generally speaking, horror movie fans should like this film - it is creepy slasher thriller.\n\n7/10",

                "reviewBody": "It&apos;s difficult to overestimate the significance of Dracula. Far more so than its predecessor, The Curse of Frankenstein, it set the tone for Hammer&apos;s movie output over the next two decades - the two decades (1956-1976) when British films, or at least British horror films, were among the best, most admired and most imitated in the world. A far cry from the terribly English whimsy of the Thirties and Forties, or the provincial, &quot;arty&quot; stuff that&apos;s predominated since the end of the Eady levy in the 1980s.\n\nWith this movie, Hammer not only created an international star out of Christopher Lee, but a worldwide phenomenon that persists, in series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and films like Sleepy Hollow, to the present day. Taking the Kensington gore quotient of The Curse of Frankenstein, and combining it with an unprecedented dose of eroticised violence, Dracula revolutionised horror, ultimately leading to the breasts and blood exploitation movies of the Seventies, as well as the heavy sexual overtones of films such as Alien and The Company of Wolves.\n\nThe movie benefits from two astonishing central performances. Christopher Lee&apos;s Dracula is a creation of passionate intensity, to whom Cushing&apos;s monomaniacal Van Helsing is the antithesis \u0096 fire and steel; hot-blooded animal instinct versus cool scientific rationalism. This has led some critics to identify Van Helsing as the real villain of the piece, a brutal fanatic who coldly pounds a stake through the vampirised Lucy. Either way, both actors give supremely effective performances. The final confrontation between the two remains the single most iconic scene in any Hammer film. Hardly surprising, given their on screen charisma, that Lee should reprise his role six times and Cushing four.\n\nThe most influential British movie of all time, Dracula&apos;s electric mix of sex and death fuelled a global revolution in genre film-making, and presented Hammer with a formula that they would return to again and again over the next two decades.",

                "reviewBody": "For me, House of Wax is a very good movie, but I am not sure if it is Price&apos;s best horror film. I did prefer the Corman-Price-Poe collaborations Pit and the Pendulum, The Raven, The Fall of the House of Usher and especially The Masque of the Red Death. The story occasionally loses bite and Phyllis Kirk is a rather bland female lead(though in all fairness her character is as well). Conversely, the Gothic sets look gorgeous and add a real sensual beauty to a lot of scenes. The photography is just as lavish. On the subject of visuals, I had the pleasure of watching House of Wax in 3D, I am not a fan of 3D and find it distracts from the film and doesn&apos;t focus on the story enough. In the case of House of Wax however, not only does the 3D look good, but it enhances the scares without making them gimmicky. Igor appearing to have leapt out of the audience was a standout. House of Wax is fine in 2D, but even better in 3D in my view, and I thought I&apos;d never say that. The music is haunting and robust, the writing is sharp and the story is suspenseful and mostly exciting. There are some very effective scenes, such as the sight of the figure in the cloak, Jarrod chasing Sue down the alleyways(pure suspense and horror), the murders especially that of Jarrod&apos;s partner, the heart-breaking scene where Jarrod tries in vain to save his wax works and Sue strapped nude on the table in the climax. The wax works are very creepy as well. The pace is brisk and the direction handles the atmosphere very well. The performances are very good on the whole, Carolyn Jones went on to do better things but is interesting to see. Frank Lovejoy is great at just playing it straight, Reggie Rymal provides another of the 3D&apos;s finest moments with the paddle-ball and Charles Bronson is wonderfully creepy even without uttering a word. Best of all is Vincent Price in his first array into horror and for me still one of his best roles, his make-up is exceptional and he is very malevolent and sympathetic, a type of role that always saw him at his best. Looking at him also, you&apos;d never guess that it was his first horror role, he looks as though he&apos;d done it for years beforehand. In conclusion, a very good film and a great 3D experience. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

                "reviewBody": "Nevermind the actual film, the idea is one of the most potent I&apos;ve seen in some time.\n\nA group of friends set out in a van in search of horror, haunted house attractions scattered around rural America. It&apos;s the days leading up to Halloween so we can have a pervasive atmosphere of masks and monsters roaming the streets. I like that it&apos;s a glimpse outside the usual and tied to a larger fabric of make-believe.\n\nThe idea is that we&apos;ll venture into these houses where horror is supposed to be controlled around us, the work of fiction, only to discover more slippery boundaries of truth. This would touch at the very essence of horror, exploiting the same perturbations that move viewers in both the actual houses and film; see, we know it&apos;s not real, but what to do when your body tells you otherwise?\n\nSo nevermind that it&apos;s actors we see and scripted reactions. Some of the most potent footage here are from within these houses where we go in with a camera and a swirl of monsters lunges at us, staged but it comes alive. I&apos;m guessing these are actual places that partnered with the filmmakers and this is what tantalized me going in; it would be at least in part an actual tour of that America that goes to pilgrimage in actual places.\n\nThey manage to bungle this for my taste, the part where fiction blurs and we go to something that comes alive in the moment of watching.\n\nFor one, they chose the &quot;found footage&quot; mode (silly name, largely the baggage of Blairwitch - it really means &quot;someone is filming this now&quot;). It&apos;s the most apt choice I&apos;ve seen since Last Exorcism, but no one ever films a sense of place and passing time, a physical sense of journey; they waste it on lots of blathering around a camera so that it ends up feeling like an episode of cable TV. Indicative of the actual makers holding the camera I guess.\n\nAnd then there&apos;s the ending. This is where the staged scenarios in these attractions don&apos;t cut it any more as the characters push for more and more &quot;real&quot; stuff. Lo, there&apos;s rumor of a secret place that you can only reach by invitation. But once there, it&apos;s the most obviously staged part of the film, the complete opposite of where we were meant to be viewing-wise.\n\nSo this is a miss, filmmakers with maybe the strongest idea of any of their peers this year but none of the tools of insight to cultivate it. They outline enough for me to imagine it in more intuitive hands so all in all I would have this over the next paranormal film.\n\nSomeone has gone out with the urge for horror in mind (and it&apos;s our very urge to inhabit illusion that made us build these houses), thinking he knows illusion from real, but it begins to spill outside, perturbing reality. From a certain point on, the apparitions become aware of someone watching, aware inside the fiction, so conspire to stage the real thing as a cosmic prank that shatters lives.\n\nWatch The Funhouse, Hooper&apos;s film driven by the same instinct, a funhouse that extends from the actual place to haunt the whole film."

                "reviewBody": "&quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; transports to you to the era of 1980&apos;s where blood, gore, chills and likes of &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; / &quot;Evil Dead&quot; spawned in plenty. And yes, for a welcome change &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; steers clear from the Japanese horror genre and pans out to be a very much American product. \n\n\u0086 Alison Lohman &quot;i can shriek&quot; delivers the right expressions warranted for a horror movie. Anything more would have been potential overdose. \n\n\u0086 Justin Long &quot;Keanu Reeves impersonator&quot; is plastic expressions all the way. \n\n\u0086 Reggie Lee &quot;corporate pacman&quot; does a good job of munching up everything that comes between him and the success ladder.\n\n\u0086 David Paymer &quot;carrot dangler&quot; knows how to make the rabbits dance to his tunes. \n\n\u0086 Lorna Raver &quot;the trigger of Lamia curse&quot; ensures to get etched in the memory and haunt you for a very long time. \n\n\u0086 Dileep Rao &quot;amateur spiritualist&quot; was okay&apos;ish. It appears his part got hijacked by his Guru.\n\n\u0086 Flor de Maria Chahua &quot;avenger in waiting&quot; has a brief but effective role. And so was her assistant. \n\nAll in all &quot;Drag Me To Hell&quot; is both tacky and cheesy, but that doesn&apos;t stop it from sending shivers down the spine. The screenplay is void of drag moments ensuring the audience get fright doses at regular intervals. Good utilisation of visual effects and the background score alleviate the visual experience. The potholes in writing could have been easily creased out. Not exactly horror-comedy like &quot;Shawn Of The Dead&quot; but it does have well-interlaced comical moments between the chills. \n\nWatchable fare... and yes a few days you potentially might abstain from using the staplers."

                "reviewBody": "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? might seem dated, but it is still an extremely riveting watch. I literally could not look away, as soon as the movie started, I couldn&apos;t stop until it had finished. Not a lot of movies can do that to me. The acting is extremely good, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are just so good as the main focus of the movie. The chilling score is suits the movie and the camera-work reminds me a lot of Hitchcock.\n\nThe story focuses on two sisters, Blanche Hudson (Joan Crawford) who was crippled in an accident awhile ago and &quot;Baby&quot; Jane Hudson (Bette Davis). Jane used to be a big child star, she even had a doll brand after her. Now, though, she is no longer recognised while her sister has recently become very famous. They live in an old mansion, with Blanche confined to her room upstairs while Jane gets madder and more cruel by the day.\n\nBette Davis gives the star performance here, some may call it over-acting but it is far from. She really makes Jane as mad, cruel and sad as possible. Joan Crawford is equally good in a very different role. She is much more timid then Jane and quite scared. The supporting cast are all good as well, especially Victor Buono as Victor Flagg, an odd pianist that befriends Jane. The black and white really are used to full effect, they make the mansion look extra creepy. Robert Aldrich&apos;s direction is fine.\n\nTo today&apos;s modern audience, this may seem boring as it does not have any action. Most of the movie is dialogue, but I do urge those who haven&apos;t seen it to do so, as it is a truly excellent movie.\n\nA solid 5/5!",

                "name": "Though Flawed and Stagy, Still Chilling After all These Years - Part One",
                "reviewBody": "I saw &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; years ago, circa 1970, for the first time, and have seen it periodically over the years. When I first saw the film, as a child, I found the film, expectedly, quite chilling. \n\nI saw it again this afternoon, after not having seen it for about three years, and still find it quite disturbing. Now that we have IMDb, I decided to offer my thoughts. And so, I was shocked to find SO MANY comments about it...more than for any other film that I&apos;ve reviewed on IMDb to date. If I add anything of unique value, great. If not, I&apos;m happy to share my review anyway.\n\nCertainly, there are flaws, or perhaps only &quot;unique differences&quot;, in this film. Primarily, it can very easily be considered a filmed play, as the staging, the dialog, and the entrances and exits of the characters throughout the film seem to be lifted directly from the stage version. Therefore, some may find the film a bit too sterile or unnatural in many ways. However, I think it is this very sterile, staged, stark-from-a-production-standpoint quality that gives the film an even eerier and in some ways far more realistic edge than might be found were it to be produced today for film, with far more slick and sophisticated sets, dialog, camera work, etc. The realism and pronounced disturbing quality of this version stems from the simple story itself, the psychological horror of which could be in some ways obfuscated from a much more sophisticated, big-studio, modern-day production. \n\nAs for the subject matter itself, I know that the number of cases, historically, involving child murderers is actually low. Therefore, some critics have argued that to take a relatively rare phenomenon, such as the child murderer, and build a motion picture around it, portraying it in the vein of plausibility, can be misleading and dangerous, giving the impression, especially to younger viewers, that child criminals are more commonplace than you may think. I wholeheartedly reject this notion. The whole purpose of acting is to portray the entire range of the human condition with as much truth as possible, no matter how rare or commonplace certain aspects of human behavior might be. Though child murderers may be few in number, it&apos;s an area worthy of as much exploration, in film, as is an ugly, unrealistic alien telling us to &quot;phone home&quot; or the sinking of the Titanic. \n\nEven though this film possesses a definite &quot;campy&quot;, staged, and perhaps even &quot;cult&quot; quality, it is chillingly effective. One reason for which this film works is due to the character of Rhoda herself, played by Patty McCormack. The smiling, blond, blue-eyed veneer of the child juxtaposed with the idea of her criminal potential (and actions) is just plain &quot;creepy&quot;. Moreover, the less you see, in terms of the actual crimes she commits, the more you conjure. And, you continually wonder who her next victim will be. Furthermore, you wonder how many people will eventually &quot;come on to her&quot; and become aware of whom she is, and how that knowledge will affect their fate.\n\nAnother reason for which this film works is because of the mother, Christine, played by Nancy Kelly. As we slowly watch her become aware of what has become of her daughter, we can&apos;t help but empathize with her predicament and her decision in handling it. The first few times I saw the film, just as I felt that Patty McCormack&apos;s portrayal and dialog delivery were probably mere replicas of what she offered on stage, I felt that Nancy Kelly&apos;s performance was affected and probably lifted directly from her work on the stage (I&apos;ve never seen a stage version, nor have I read the book, yet). But in the case of Ms. Kelly, watching her realize what she has ultimately given birth to and raised is very heart wrenching. Moreover, I have always wondered if the use of her right hand was a direction given to her by either of her directors (for play or film), or if it was something she came up with herself. Two instances come to mind. \n\nIn the first one, the manner in which she hits the table with her right hand as she listens to what is happening outside near her shed while Rhoda plays &quot;Au Claire de la Lune&quot; on her piano is very pronounced, appears somewhat odd and is perhaps symbolic. She seemed to be pounding her hand not only in outward denial and anger at the realization she now has of what her child is capable of committing, but as a means to torture and punish herself for having given birth to her in the first place. In the second instance, Nancy Kelly used her right hand again in a very pronounced manner when she offers Rhoda her vitamins &quot;that night&quot;. Again, I couldn&apos;t help but wonder what symbolism she wanted us to draw from her gesture. It might be said that this very hand, which once comforted and fed her child all her life, has now become the tool that feeds the ultimate fate of her child toward the end of the film. (Again, not having read it, I have a fairly good idea how the book ends).\n\nAs for how the ending/epilogue in the film was handled, practically everyone on this site who has offered a review knows that the use of the &quot;casting call&quot; was basically dictated by the mandates of the Hays Code. I&apos;ll just add that I find that the chilling effect of the story carries over to this bizarre &quot;epilogue&quot;. I still find it a bit unsettling to see each of these actors take their bows, especially considering that some of the characters they portrayed would, in my estimation, appear stranger to a child than does Rhoda....particularly Leroy, when he bows to the viewing audience carrying his large pitchfork."

                "reviewBody": "One of the unwritten laws of the movies is that Stephen King books are nearly always disappointing when transferred to the big screen. One film which doesn&apos;t fit that rule is The Dead Zone. In the hands of David Cronenberg, you may expect this to be a gore-filled affair, but it is actually a very well-made, subtle film which emphasises the psychological sense of fear rather than settling for blood-spattered mayhem. There isn&apos;t a moment in the film that will make you jump out of your seat, but it is still an effectively scary film because it plays on your mind.\n\n Normal, down-to-earth everyman Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) is involved in a terrible car crash which leaves him comatose. Four years later, he miraculously awakens. To begin with, he is devastated to learn that his girlfriend has moved on, marrying and starting a family with another man. But soon he realises that this is the least of his problems. He soon discovers that the accident has left him with remarkable powers, which enable him to see into people&apos;s futures just by touching their hand. And Johnny is in for one hell of a nasty shock when he shakes hands with potential senator Greg Stillson (Martin Sheen) at a political rally....\n\n An intelligently paced and very well-acted film, The Dead Zone is also full of unpredictable plot developments. Walken elicits great sympathy as the normal guy who rapidly learns that his new gift is actually a curse, and there are fabulous supporting performances from Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Brooke Adams and the terrifying Martin Sheen. The film has several tremendous moments, but the climax in particular builds to an emotional crescendo. The premise of The Dead Zone is probably rather silly if you stop to think about it, but other than that it is a most impressive film - and still ranks as one of, if not THE, best adaptation of a Stephen King story so far.",

                "reviewBody": "I find it impossible to give this movie less than a seven, because, even if the ending was absolutely a letdown, the first 80% of the movie was so excellently constructed that its cinematic value cannot be lessened too greatly.\n\nAnd excellent The House of the Devil is for most of its duration. Director/Writer/Editor Ti West shows a remarkable proficiency for being able to truly scare, through an excellent slow-burn build-up, allowing the atmosphere of the titular house and the anticipation for when it is inevitably released to bring a viewer to nail-biting fear, rather than simply trying to startle with constant Boo! Got&apos;cha! &quot;scares,&quot; or excessive gore. In the end, this method is far more effective and lasting, less artificial than the latter methods which seem to, unfortunately, be the bread and butter of modern American horror filmmakers.\n\nHowever, when the denouement rolls around, this is completely thrown out the window. Sure, the gore may look nice (and indeed it does; not top of the line, but it belies the film&apos;s budget), but it completely abandons House&apos;s almost regal sense of restraint that worked so effectively for nearly the entire length of the movie. Not to mention, the transition in styles is itself so jarring that I was pulled from the experience for nearly 10 minutes, an unfortunate occurrence when that covers almost the entire duration of the remainder. The release of the built up fear was clumsy and ineffective, and the effect of the movie after the credits rolled was erased. I wasn&apos;t left with the feeling that something could be lurking just out of sight over my shoulder that the best horror movies provide; a tension that extends beyond the movie&apos;s run-time. This problem I believe to later be solved by Ti West&apos;s later film &quot;The Innkeepers,&quot; a picture I believe (and seemingly in the minority) to be the superior movie.\n\nHowever, despite its eventual letdown, the remainder of House of the Devil was truly a horror experience I rarely see from recent American horror films, this difference between House of the Devil and its peers thrown into sharp relief by the clearly nostalgic feel it gives off, even from the opening credits. Even the grainy camera shots add a sense of, for lack of a better word, enjoyable &quot;retro&quot; style, rather than becoming a detriment. And the camera work itself is also exemplary, snaking and twisting its way among the oppressive halls of the house that seems more an antique than something to be lived in.\n\nThe House of the Devil is unquestionably a good movie. For most of the film, I was completely drawn in, waiting with a rising anticipation to see what was lurking around the corner; The House of the Devil is truly scary even with its superficial sense of the mundane. Nothing is shown, save for one particularly haunting shot of what lies behind a door that remains (at least temporarily) unopened, and it is all the better for that. But this is before (please excuse the pun) everything goes to Hell at the climax. I&apos;d certainly recommend this film; just don&apos;t expect the release to be able to come close to matching the rising action.",

                "reviewBody": "At the zoo, Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) sees the mysterious Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), who is sketching a black panther. He&apos;s intrigued by her--it seems to be love at first sight--and is surprised when she invites him into her apartment for a cup of tea. While in her apartment, he sees an odd statue of a man on horseback, holding a sword-skewered cat high in the air. Dubrovna tells him of her native Serbia, and the legend of unchristian &quot;cat people&quot; who were driven into the mountains. Dubrovna&apos;s behavior becomes increasingly odd, and animals often react strangely to her. Could she have something to do with the legend of the cat people? \n\nThis was director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Lewton&apos;s first horror/thriller film together (they were to do two others together, I Walked With A Zombie (1943) and The Leopard Man (1943)), and for my money, this is the best of the three. Lewton was famous for understated, atmospheric horror that suggested more than it showed, a style that is also evident in his later collaborations with director Robert Wise (who went on to direct the infamous The Haunting (1963), which is often thought to be a pinnacle of this more &quot;suggestive&quot; style, although it&apos;s not a particular favorite of mine).\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, a lot of younger horror fans, for whom the oldest film that they are really familiar with in the genre is something like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) or an even more recent film, might be reluctant to call Cat People a horror film. It is &quot;talky&quot;, doesn&apos;t contain any graphic violence, and we don&apos;t even see a horror creature/villain until just a glimpse near the very end of the film. But it is horror--the talking is centered on a captivating supernatural &quot;myth&quot;, there are a lot of creepy, well-photographed scenes laden with heavy shadows, there are a couple exquisite chase/suspense scenes, and there is a lot of complex, dark psychological interaction.\n\nThe psychological tension is really the focus, as Lewton and Tourneur&apos;s films together are moral parables that function more as a metaphor for horror (rather than the more common flipside, where the horror is more prominent and might be a metaphor for some other kind of philosophical point). In this case, the moral and social situations are varied and complex, but are all focused on romantic relationships, ranging from quick actions taken due to lust, to emotional distancing, adultery and abuse of power. The more one watches the film, the more one is likely to get out of the subtextual messages. They remain more subtextual than they might in modern cinema because of content restrictions imposed by studios in this era (although of course those were a reaction to prevalent cultural attitudes at the time). But in retrospect, the buried nature of the themes is a benefit, at least in this case.\n\nOccasionally, the horrific aspect of these types of films can be too understated, so that they simply become realist dramas. That&apos;s not the case here. This is a film that is rewarding on many levels.\n\nA 9 out of 10 from me.",

                "reviewBody": "Laura (Belen Rueda) returns to the orphanage she spent time in as a child with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and little boy Simon (Roger Princep) in hopes of re-establishing it as seaside retreat for children with disabilities only to find there may be some former residents who never left. In Juan Antonio Bayona&apos;s tightly wound &quot;The Orphanage&quot; nothing is as it seems and child&apos;s play takes on sinister overtones.\n\nBayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones. Whereas &quot;Pan&apos;s Labyrinth&quot; took a dark fantasy approach to a Passion Play, &quot;The Orphanage&quot; is closer to the classic haunted house themes of &quot;The Others&quot; as it attempts to give a sentimental view of life after death. Be warned, &quot;The Orphanage&quot; is often more sad than scary, and those not familiar with Catholic mysticism might find things a bit hard to believe. As goes the film&apos;s mantra...Believe, Then You Will See. Those with the patience and the heart will be greatly rewarded as the audience doesn&apos;t necessarily have to Believe to relate to the characters who do.\n\nWorking from refined &quot;less is more&quot; psychological horror templates, Bayona delivers the formulaic goods. There will be a simplistic but heartfelt exploration of grief. There will be allusions to classic literature (in this case a very nicely done &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as Catholic allegory motif). There will be uncovering dark secrets from the past. There will be precocious children with spooky imaginary friends. There will be creaking set designs and manipulative sound effects to create &quot;gotcha!&quot; moments. There will be a creepy medium (an excellent Geraldine Chaplin) brought in for a s\u00e9ance. And there will be a twist at the end.\n\nThankfully, there is also a great performance from Belen Rueda as Laura. She gives a compelling portrayal of a woman devoured by her loss and achingly desperate for the truth no matter how horrific that truth might be. One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed. &quot;The Orphanage&quot; offers nothing terribly new, but sometimes the same old ghost story presented in a beautiful way makes for the best type of cold-rainy-day entertainment.",

                "reviewBody": "There are already several comments left, but what the hey, I liked this movie and I&apos;m gonna have my 10p worth.\n\nBefore I mention the movie itself, I&apos;d better comment on modern Asian movies that reach Western shores, and the fact that they have different pacing, priorities and styles to what you would see at the cinema. The fact that a lot of people don&apos;t &apos;get&apos; the parts of this film which seem to have no relevance is probably as much due to the difference in culture more than any wrongdoing on the production team&apos;s behalf. The same can be said for a lot of Hong Kong comedies, the &apos;humour&apos; which would probably illicit a wry laugh back home flies miles over everybody else&apos;s head.\n\nIn that sort of circumstance, I&apos;ve developed a good trick, I switch-off trying to figure out what all these little hints and gestures mean and concentrate on the character interactions and the scares. I&apos;ve had a lot of practice, Western cinema in recent years has been guilty of &apos;rambling&apos;, and they&apos;ve got no such excuse as &apos;cultural differences&apos; ;)\n\nAnyway, the movie! (good grief!), the plot&apos;s already been explained and probed, so I won&apos;t go into that. What this film has is a constant &apos;pressure&apos;, a claustrophobic atmosphere which persists regardless of the location. Clever camera work afoot! The palpable distance which the heroine feels from her family and the people around her (perhaps a symptom of not being able to communicate non-verbally with them so long? Perhaps not, but it&apos;s there) is always there too. You get the impression that she could be surrounded by a crowd and still walk alone from one side of a city to the other.\n\nThe smaller roles are played out very nicely, great acting considering the film concentrates almost solely on the two main characters.\n\nThe ending is a little bit of a let-down, predictable and not entirely &apos;working&apos;. But, BUT, it isn&apos;t a catastrophe which ruins the film, which I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll know what I mean. The ending of a film is what you&apos;re left with when you switch off the TV, and if it&apos;s bad, then so is the film.\n\nThis movie is the only one in recent years which actually gave me a start, and that&apos;s something. Real horror isn&apos;t about dripping guts and hooks with heads on them, it&apos;s about the unexpected, it&apos;s about being confronted with something terrifying, something which makes you wish the character was elsewhere. In order to achieve that, you need to give a damn about the character in the first place, which is where 90% of cheap horrors fall down. Not here, the characters are likable and have a little childlike innocence about them, you want to get in there and slap the more unpleasant visitors :P\n\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed watching this film, and intend to buy it when I find it for a pittance (almost all DVDs can be found for the right price at one time or another, shop around and ask people where they get their bargains). I would heartily recommend renting before buying, however. As several have mentioned already, there are several elements of this film which seem to have been deliberately copied from recent films such as Sixth Sense. If that prospect leaves a sour taste, I&apos;d look elsewhere, but everyone else who hasn&apos;t had enough of all that yet should certainly have a look :D\n\nThanks for reading."

Regardless of merit. It is all about the dollars.\n\nA story as pure as this one -- penned by Kevin Brodbin -- could never be done today because it lacks the setup for a dozen spinoffs and sequels, as well as the mandatory backstory and product placements.\n\nSporting two of the most charismatic and photogenic stars of all time, at the peak of their careers, we have a story with no bad lines, no lapses in the arcs, and no time wasted. Just pure, engrossing, film pleasure from beginning to end.\n\nYes, I know that it was not appreciated in its day. But the future is always the final judge.\n\n((Designated &quot;IMDb Top Reviewer.&quot; Please check out my list &quot;167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))",

Oh man! It&apos;s creepy and exceedingly ominous and the shaky-cam newsreel quality gives it an extra punch.\n\nThe plot: You don&apos;t have to be a genius to understand what is going on in this film, but you do need to pay attention. The supernatural physics is a little nonsensical, of the &quot;Popular science&quot; variety, but the basic premise is explained in layman terms.\n\nThe characters: Actually, while the &quot;science&quot; is hocus-pocus, I really liked that the film&apos;s characters were mostly grad students. The actors do a great job of portraying annoyed, skeptical science grad students. Horror flicks are filled with numbskull undergrads, and it is nice to see the hidden sector of college life revealed in its nerdy glory.\n\nThe skinny: I&apos;d describe it as a Biblical/Lovecraft horror film. It&apos;s got the whole &quot;evil universe&quot; theme running alongside an effective &quot;Hell breaks loose&quot; plot.",

The film is in one location, because it focuses on a radio station, as a zombie outbreak is happening, and calls and reports come in with what is happening. It starts off slow, but builds up more.\n\nSo it is more creepy than action based or, gory. It has some pretty interesting theories to how the zombie virus is spreading. It&apos;s certainly a stretch, but I like that&apos;s it&apos;s exploding something different.\n\nIt&apos;s an enjoyable watch if you just allow you suspension of disbelief, and fancy something with a different pace.",

                "reviewBody": "Twenty years on, and The Others still rates as one of the best, most memorable horrors of the last two decades. It doesn&apos;t have the cheap gore or lazy scares that so many do, this has the element of menace, the scares are more measured, and suitably placed.\n\nIt&apos;s very different to almost every other horror I can think of, it&apos;s like a story from a much earlier era, but given up to date production values and acting. It benefits of course from such a wonderful cast, Kidman is awesome, and does a terrific English accent.\n\nThe ending came as a massive surprise, and was perhaps the most chilling element of the film. It is loaded with atmosphere, it&apos;s thoroughly engrossing, I would hugely recommend this film, 10/10.",

Today I got a chance to see the Japanese original. Even though I saw it second and it doesn&apos;t have the same production value as the American version, I still liked it.\n\n&quot;Ju-On&quot; bucked the trend a bit that you see with just about every movie dealing with hauntings or poltergeists; they jumped to level ten with the ghosts. 99% of horror movies involving a specter start off very slowly like the ghost is working up the nerve to fully scare the victim. In &quot;Ju-On,&quot; because there are multiple victims, the tortured soul wastes no time. You have to appreciate a ghost who wants to get things done promptly.",

                "reviewBody": "This is Roger Corman\u00b4s first Edgar Allan Poe-based movie and probably the best of them all in terms of direction, acting and script. It\u00b4s certainly the best adapted one, because it manages to build a larger story around the events of the tale without borrowing material from other tales and without making it seem obvious, unlike the sequels. Anyway, probably my favorite is still &quot;Masque of the red death&quot; which is also my favorite Poe tale. The rest deserves a look, of course, but it doesn\u00b4t get any better.\n\nVincent Price stars as Roderick Usher, a man obsessed with the tragic history of the Usher clan, filled with psychopats, murderers of all kinds and people who die of incurable illnesses. He forces his sister Madeline (Myrna Fahey) to stay in the house waiting for death to spare the world the horrors of the Usher family in years to come and even builds two separate coffins for them. Madeline\u00b4s fiancee (Mark Damon) goes looking for her to the house and is received by the obedient butler Bristol (Harry Ellerbe). From there on this four characters will go through a lot of arguing, running around the House (which, like in the Poe tale, is a character itself, one of a really menacing nature) and digging on ancient secrets. Any Corman or Poe afficionado can figure out the rest of the story by himself, but it\u00b4s a joy to watch it evolve here.\n\nThe star of the show is Vincent Price, of course. He puts in a black robe or a red silk suit and speaks in a low, soft, modulated voice, throwing his overwrought dialogue while the others just stare at him with surprise and fear. He has a special weakness of the hearing (I have the same problem, BTW, although not to this extent) and in one scene the fiancee screams at him hard enough to make him twitch in pain. In that scene you realize just what a genius he is. The set decoration is also to be noted (you won\u00b4t forget easily the paintings of the Usher family members by Burt Schonberg), as is the music and practically everything that sets the unbelievable mood this movie has."

                "reviewBody": "Mutual distrust turns to uneasy alliance as an alien invasion forces a group of British teens to work together with a nurse who they mugged in this action thriller starring John Boyega as the leader of the teen gang. Boyega is just as effective here as in &apos;The Force Awakens&apos;, giving his hardened character a vulnerable, human side bubbling beneath the surface. The actors who play his young friends are well cast too. Jodie Whitaker is less effective as the nurse and Nick Frost is criminally underused, but in general, there is a lot to like about how the characters interact here. There are even some scattered comic moments to be had in how everyone from the teenagers&apos; girlfriends to the local teen drug lord scoffs at their claims of being under alien attack. The gradual bonding between Whitaker and the teens, who she initially describes a &quot;monsters&quot;, in the face of *real* monsters is where the film succeeds best though - so much so that the action sequences end up being a low point of the movie. Without any eyes and glowing sharp jaws, the creatures are quite unsettling to look at, but all the attack scenes become a little repetitive with the film sagging towards the middle. The movie certainly ends on a very high note, however, with a third act that potently pushes the film&apos;s single biggest message about teen thugs always being misunderstood and never properly recognised.",

                "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed Yuzna&apos;s &quot;Society,&quot; which I view as a rather clever send off to the 80s: A satire of sorts in which an outsider teen chases the unobtainable girl, engages with his wacky friends and confronts a family that is increasingly alien to him. The tropes were John Hughes; but the special effects were Stan Winston: straight out of the animatronics and puppet cabinet of that time. It was very clever (and rather gross!)\n\n&quot;The Dentist&quot; is not that film. There is almost no social commentary; and frankly it plays rather straight forward: Corbin Bernsen&apos;s &quot;Alan&quot; is the titular main character who becomes unhinged when his trophy wife takes up with the pool boy. There is a pretense that Alan is obsessed with ridding the world of dirt and decay (get it?!) Thus his wife&apos;s actions set loose a screw that has long been barely secured inside of him. But that&apos;s pretty thin as plot devices go.\n\nSo, original? Certainly not. But the cast is wonderful, and the dark humor make it worth the watch (like &quot;Society,&quot; this film includes some running gags and camera work that presage the likes of &quot;Scrubs&quot; and &quot;Malcolm ITM.&quot; Look for &quot;Sarah&quot; and the IRS agent.)\n\nSo why is &quot;The Dentist&quot; listed in IMdb as straight horror? Got me. It is definitely horror-comedy as far as I am concerned. Yes, it is gory, but a great deal of that is centered on the good doctor lapsing into a psychological rage as he works. Anyone who has ever visited a dentist will cringe.",

                "reviewBody": "I heard the hype. How this film was &quot;so horrific&quot; that people left midway through the film after being so repulsed, they were physically ill. I went in with the - negative - expectation that this was going to be a gore fest. SPOILER: it&apos;s not. What we have here is a particularly grisly, but effective coming of age story, a genre the French have a penchant for. For a film about cannibalism, it&apos;s surprisingly subtle and is generally a slow burn that builds tension well. I found the performances uniformly strong, especially from Garance Millier. Her transformation from shy and socially awkward to animalistic and unhinged is a joy to watch. The atmosphere is well developed, especially those incredibly effective party scenes that perfectly capture what it&apos;s like at a wild college party. And I have to say, for such a twisted film, it&apos;s surprisingly sexy. Again, thank the French. \n\nNo, it&apos;s not for the faint of heart and yes, some of the imagery is quite brutal. It could&apos;ve have fleshed out - heh - some of the relationships between certain characters better, but overall, I&apos;d recommend this to people with open minds and strong stomachs.",

                "reviewBody": "Four college kids are sent to an abandoned mansion to fend for themselves during a hazing ritual gone wrong in &quot;Hell Night.&quot; During their stay at Garth Manor, the group deal with pesky pranks from their peers and face off against a &quot;gork&quot; dubbed Andrew. We never find out what a gork is exactly, but it sounds relatively un-PC. At any rate, Andrew &quot;Gork&quot; Garth is a deformed child who has been left alone to his own devices. Now that he&apos;s all grown up, he&apos;s hellbent on murdering anyone who steps foot onto his property. That&apos;s unfortunate for Linda Blair and company, who lack the benefit of something like TripAdvisor. One thing&apos;s for sure, though; if they live through the night, this place is getting a dismal one-star review.\n\n&quot;Hell Night&quot; came out in 1981, just as the slasher genre was gaining traction. It is at times derivative, and at others, it surprisingly deviates from the beaten path. The initial set up of four characters who alternate between horny, funny, smart and sympathetic is one we&apos;ve seen countless times in the genre, but &quot;Hell Night&quot; puts a refreshing spin on things. For starters, its cast has a chemistry and a shared likability rarely seen in the slasher subset. An all-grown-up Linda Blair leads the cast with her charming girl-next-door presence, while pretty-boy Peter Barton (&quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot;) plays her good-guy boyfriend. In the next room are the Spicoli-esque surfer dude and his hilariously charming and sexy girlfriend, played by Vincent Van Patten (son of Dick) and Suki Goodwin respectively. Goodwin in particular is a real firecracker, an endless ball of charm. It&apos;s a shame she quit acting shortly after this film came out. Her comedic chemistry with Van Patten jumps off the screen and nearly steals the show. That being said, all four actors are quite solid and work together to keep the film going, even through it&apos;s duller moments.\n\nSpeaking of dull moments, there&apos;s more than a few of those here. Since the film is about 15-20 minutes longer than the average slasher, it&apos;s only natural this would happen. The atmosphere is pretty well established early on, and while the characters are never a chore to visit, the often-protracted stalking sequences can sometimes feel endless or even pointless. Having said that, when the jump scares hit, they hit hard. The film is a bit of a workhorse in that regard, as by the end, we are treated to a big jump seemingly every other minute. Tim DeSimone, who had previously worked in the adult film industry under the impossibly awesome psuedonym of Lancer Brooks, apes the likes of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot; quite competently here. There are moments midway through the film that feel like someone traced over John Carpenter&apos;s work, right down to the sparse, synth-led score. Yet, for all that it borrows, it never feels entirely redundant. One digression in particular, where a lead character escapes the mansion and goes off to find help, is a welcome curveball. It&apos;s little moments like this that give the film its own unique flavor.\n\n While one could probably spend the bulk of its running length nit-picking it to death, there&apos;s just something undeniably charming about the way &quot;Hell Night&quot; plays out. It feels familiar, but at the same time, keeps us on our toes. With characters that you actually want to see survive and a killer who is not wearing a mask or wielding a chainsaw, &quot;Hell Night&quot; at least offers something you won&apos;t always find in &apos;80s slashers. It&apos;s not a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but necessary viewing for any fan of the genre. &quot;Hell Night&quot; is, like the ritual itself: a rite of passage everyone should go through at least once.",

                "reviewBody": "An exceptional cast and intelligent direction seals the quality of the first &apos;talkie&apos; version of Robert Louis Stevenson&apos;s tale. Often hailed as the best of the many screen adaptations of the story, director Robert Moumalin exploits the symbolic potential of the tale as well as boldly tapping into popular Freudian trends concerning sexual repression. The result is not a by-the-numbers rendition but an effective interpretation with quirks and dimensions of its own. Yet the film belongs to Frederic March who scooped an Oscar for his sensational dual role. Although as Jekyll he unfortunately has to trade flowery romantic dialogue with Rose Hobart, there can be no disputing the menace of his Hyde, with his simian-like appearance, top hat, cloak and cane, who turns cockney hooker Miriam Hopkins&apos; life into a nightmare. It&apos;s a breathtaking transformation both physically (thanks to stellar make-up and special effects) and artistically and is undoubtedly the centrepiece of this excellent vintage classic."

                "reviewBody": "Set in an oil industry ghost town-like city in Iran, this movie, directed by newcomer Ana Lily Amirpour - an American of Iranian descent - is highly reminiscent of Jim Jarmusch&apos;s early style. Interestingly, in an interview between her and legendary producer/director Roger Corman on the DVD extras, she claims she&apos;s not much of a fan of Jarmusch. But as virtually everyone who studies film has pointed at the stylistic similarity, she&apos;s taking it as a compliment.\n\nLike Jarmusch&apos;s work, the movie is shot in atmospheric black and white - and it works beautifully. The dialogue is all Persian (Farsi) - even though the movie was shot in America, standing in for Iran - and is subsequently sub-titled. However, this does not work against the film (whose strength is its visuals) at all, as the dialogue is at all times minimal and slow, thus making the reading easy and unobstructive to the fascinating camera work.\n\nSo, it&apos;s a horror movie. It&apos;s principal character is a Persian woman vampire - who stalks the town, robed in a black chador, which is quite an unsettling shadow to behold standing 10 feet away from a potential victim late at night. The events exist within a kind of imagined Iranian underworld of pimps, hookers, drug dealers and street urchins. Our vampire watches this dark town, at times slowly riding a skateboard down the street! When she interacts with people, she is unblinking, mostly un-verbal, and seems to be at all times appraising their circumstances and their worth.\n\nAside from the beautiful blocking shots and photography, a high point of the film is its use of sound effects, music (which sometimes references Morricone-like spaghetti westerns) and an impressive soundtrack of mostly modern pop music.\n\nAny criticism of this movie (though it&apos;s more praised than not) seems to center around it being &quot;style over substance&quot; and &quot;too slowly paced&quot;. Well, it is moody, that&apos;s for sure - and maybe too slow for many of today&apos;s horror fans, that&apos;s true - but there&apos;s no arguing that its greatest strength is its style.",

The guy that just inherited the house is a little spooked by all the ghost stories, and wants it checked out. So he hires Carter Simms, a sort of ghost documentarian, to spend a few days in the house and gather evidence.\n\nSounds pretty ho-hum, huh? It isn&apos;t. This film gave me the willies. It&apos;s relatively low-budget - shot on video, and the first little bit of the film makes you think &apos;how can this be any good?&apos; But trust me, this film had me seeing things in the shadows at the end of the hall before it was half over. NOT a film to watch alone at night in the suburbs. There&apos;s lots of &apos;little bits&apos; of gore, and some absolutely unnerving ghost stuff. (I&apos;ve got goosebumps just thinking about it).\n\nThis is a very well crafted film. As I said earlier, it&apos;s not big budget, but clearly everyone involved is VERY good at what they do. Good direction, cinematography and editing. The makeup and effects were top notch. Of special note, the lead actress (Patti Tindall) was excellent and super watchable. I hope we see more of her in the future. The rest of the cast were good as well, but the lead really gave the film depth and weight that made it that much more terrifying to watch.",

                "reviewBody": "The royal court roars with laughter. A group of jesters grin and jeer at one another, do cartwheels, breathe fire. In the midst of all this mirth, the Queen sits sad and silent on her throne. Her eyes fall on one of the players and suddenly she runs off, distraught. The King chases after her, shouting that he is sorry, that he did not know. His apologies fall on deaf ears.\n\nSo begins Tale of Tales, Matteo Garrone&apos;s visually striking, but ultimately uninspiring adaptation of the Pentamerone, a book of Italian folk stories collected in the 17th century.The film cuts between three separate narrative strands, linked together by the unifying theme of all-consuming obsession. One tale centres around a monarch mad with lust, and two crones in his kingdom who desire only to be young again. Another depicts a woman who will do anything for motherhood. The third tale introduces us to a king&apos;s unhealthy fascination with a flea, and an ogre unable to set free his reluctant and unhappy bride.\n\nFairy tales these may be, but their delightfully disturbing content ensures that they are not meant for children. (At least by modern, if not by 17th century standards \u2013 the Pentamerone, just as full of sex and violence as Garrone&apos;s 15 rated film, was subtitled &apos;Entertainment for Little Ones&apos;). Yet even though Tale of Tales is too graphic and gruesome for kids and is clearly aimed at older audiences, it remains too childishly straightforward to be captivating. I would have needed either more nuance or more mystery and suggestion for the film to draw me in and immerse me in its world. There are, for instance, scenes where characters morph into a different physical shape. Had these transformations remained unexplained by the narrative they would have evoked a sense of wonder and significance, like visual poems hinting at some elusive but compelling underlying idea. Instead, the characters transform because a magician cast a spell, and there is nothing to think about. It is the kind of simple cause and effect storytelling with a clear moral \u2013 for all three narrative strands put forward the idea that &apos;obsession is not good for you&apos; \u2013 which works so well for children&apos;s stories, but is too obvious to really interest adults.\n\nTo be fair, it was never Garrone&apos;s intention to prompt intellectual engagement with Tale of Tales. &apos;Don&apos;t try to understand it. Just feel it, like when you are standing in front of a painting. Follow the characters, take the journey, feel the emotion,&apos; the director said in a Guardian interview. But the characters are too one-dimensional to seem real, and I found it hard to care about their lives or fates. They also speak far too much to function well as figures onto whom one can project emotion, like when one is standing in front of a painting. It should have been show not tell, with the camera lingering on the characters&apos; facial expressions, and allowing spectators to empathise and identify with them. Instead, feelings, from love to longing, are spoken \u2013 &apos;He&apos;s like a brother to me&apos;, &apos;I want to be young again&apos; \u2013 and the action moves forward.\n\nLess would have been more, with Tale of Tales. The power of the film lies in its visuals, which are beguiling, gorgeous and grotesque. The dialogues and narrative explanations serve only to trivialise the images, lessening the overall effect of the film. The trailer for Tale of Tales, a succession of visuals set to nothing but music,is better than the film itself.",

There were actually not that many &apos;scary&apos; scenes, but it was what I feared would come. But don&apos;t let that fool you- this is a film that I will be afraid to think about when I go to sleep. The sound effects are incredibly tense and very creepy, to the point that they are disturbing. Certain images in the film are sure to stay with me for a long time. As far as plot goes, like I expected, I knew there would be a twist at the end, but the film does so many different things with itself that I never knew how it was going to come. When all is said and done, the actual twist isn&apos;t even all the surprising, BUT the final 20 minutes getting there are very, very tense and I could not look away. \n\nI also want to give a shout out to Peter Mullan, who gives a fascinating performance here. He is the driving force of the film. Also, the cinematography, editing, score, and sound make this perhaps one of the creepiest and unsettling films of its decade. I look forward to rewatching this."

A very interesting point made by the director (who had already done Girlfight and Jennifer&apos;s Body) over a possible processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. A lot of tension, making us doubt who you believe (or even what is real) at every step, until the crux of the matter comes; you may wait a little for that, but it&apos;s worth it. Point for the director for not using low blows. Worthwhile if you want to spend a very intense time. With regards to actors&apos; work, &quot;Will&quot; comes out unscathed. &quot;Eden&quot; maybe a little artificial, but I think it is an intentional nuance given by the director. The rest comes off well. The screenplay is pretty good. Although it is not revolutionary, the pace is accurate, keeps the suspense, and plays with ambiguity.",

My personal opinion is that this is more of a good mystery movie than a horror movie - it really wasn&apos;t that scary, to me at least. The only really scary moments were spoiled for me because I had already seen them before on things like &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; on TV or something, and the notes by a critic inside the DVD box also spoiled it.\n\nSound design was one part of this film that struck me - quite good at doing what it was supposed to, sometimes unsettling. I didn&apos;t feel a lot of character to be honest - just people making their way through the story.\n\nIn my opinion, worth seeing just to investigate the hype, but don&apos;t expect to need a new change of underwear after seeing it. For that, you might want to consider The Grudge.",

This movie was never meant to be filmed in a pro way.\n\nThis movie is about how your will and your life falls to pieces when\n\nfacing something that could be a nightmare and you feel you&apos;re\n\ntotally awake. This movie is about desperation, about your life\n\nbeing taken from you with hours to feel how you will not be the\n\nsame, because you know it&apos;s over for you, but you don&apos;t want to\n\nbelieve it... something we like to call hope.\n\nYou may have entered Open Water willing to eat all your popcorn\n\nand coming out of the theater telling jokes and feeling life is here\n\nforever. But this movie is about the opposite. \n\nThis is a wonderful film, and I thought Susan was going to be\n\nbit**ing all the time and stuff, but she didn&apos;t. The ending was so\n\ndamn sad. I left the theater in a quiet fashion. I couldn&apos;t say a word\n\nto my girlfriend because I knew she felt for them too.\n\nYou don&apos;t need character development when you turn on the news\n\nand see millions of unknowns blown to pieces or starving. You\n\ndon&apos;t need it because you know they are like you. Made of the\n\nsame matter, and as fragile as any other animal.\n\nOpen Water is a beautiful piece of movie-making, and it&apos;s so\n\nhuman that it&apos;s almost unreal."

                "reviewBody": "&quot;Grace&quot;, the long feature debut of writer/director Paul Solet, is an oddly unsettling but refreshingly inventive horror-drama hybrid that can&apos;t possibly be categorized into one single genre. This film is deeply disturbing, emotionally moving, darkly comical and intellectually engaging all at the same time and that is quite a remarkable thing to achieve for a young director who only shot a few short movies before, is it not? &quot;Grace&quot; literally baths in an unclassifiable grisly atmosphere, the detailed character drawings are unique and plausible and the concept \u2013 although rationally impossible \u2013 is nightmarishly upsetting. The announcer at the Belgian Fantasy Festival, where I watched this movie, advised for couples with young children and particularly pregnant women to leave the theater and that was definitely a good move (not that there were many), as this instant gem covers pretty much all the imaginable horrors of motherhood, like troublesome conception, intrusive mother-in-laws, alternate delivery methods, loss of husband and \u2013 worst of all \u2013 a still born baby. Madeline doesn&apos;t really care about too much except for the 7-months-old fetus in her wombs and bringing it into this world in an old-fashioned and natural way, with a traditional midwife and vitamins instead of a hospital doctors and anesthetics. When the baby stops moving after a tragic car accident, in which also her docile husband dies, Madeline is nevertheless determined to give birth when the time is due. The baby, Grace, miraculously comes out of the womb alive and seemingly healthy, but soon after Madeline&apos;s biggest ordeal comes to the surface. Grace needs blood instead of breast milk and, the devoted mother she is, Madeline does everything within her power to provide this. Meanwhile, mother-in-law Vivian tries to do everything to obtain guardianship over Grace as she&apos;s convinced Madeline is mentally incapable of nursing her granddaughter. The sequences where Madeline &quot;sacrifices&quot; her own health in order to feed her eccentric baby girl are simultaneously disruptive and affectionate. This is a peculiar combination of sentiment that we&apos;re really not used to witnessing in the horror genre, but it&apos;s extremely compelling to say the least. Also the sub plot involving the aging Vivian rediscovering her femininity is disturbing, but in a totally and never before experienced fashion. &quot;Grace&quot; contains multiple shocking moments and grueling images, especially near the end, but the violence or bloodshed is never at one point exploitative or tasteless. So, cult loving horror fans please don&apos;t start thinking this is a modern update of Larry Cohen&apos;s early 70&apos;s crazed killer baby flick &quot;It&apos;s Alive&quot; or you risk feeling very much ripped off. This is an often uncomfortably slow-paced and intriguing psychological drama/thriller, with stylish photography and hypnotizing acting performances. Jordan Ladd is amazing as Madeline and this was probably the first film set where she could demonstrate her talented acting capacities, because until now I only saw her in lighter horror stuff like &quot;Death Proof&quot; and &quot;Club Dread&quot;. Ladd also receives superb support from Gabrielle Rose as Vivian (truly a courageous performance) and Samantha Ferris as the alternative midwife. &quot;Grace&quot; honestly is a movie you won&apos;t forget about easily, that is one guarantee I can give you.",

As is customary in the genre, the events that unfold some months later are probably more a reflection of the guilt, mental health and anguish being suffered by the young driver, although to believe the type of sadistic pairing he encounters exists, and that they were able to get away with their brutality in the first instance, is far from believable (or maybe not in the place this was made). If you like a bit of incestuous, torturous tyranny, like the aforementioned pair, for no other reason than that&apos;s how you get your kicks, then pile in and gorge on the cruelty and sadistic savagery of shallowness.",

The lingering atmosphere is done incredibly well from the beginning, helped along by a combination of a tense score and the use of extended periods of silence. The acting is bang-on and you don&apos;t know when or how it is going to end. The movie doesn&apos;t have &apos;twists&apos; exactly, but the way it is written keeps you guessing constantly. And I personally loved the ending. Though the potential is there to use a more standard approach, The Witch however opts to go down a more subtle avenue, leading to the true nature of religious persecution that is on full display here. Additionally, elements of the story have been taken from historical documents, adding another layer of grimness. The supernatural elements are obviously up for discussion, but that these tales were written centuries ago somehow adds more to this disturbing film.\n\nThe film is set in 1630, in New England, America. A Puritan family is banished from town for their beliefs (or it at least seems this way, perhaps based on real events). They are forced to move to a farm that feels like it is on the edge of the world, as from the opening the woods that line the farm are presented in ominous fashion, almost creating a character that could serve as the scariest element of the film. What exactly goes on in there? Why can&apos;t the children venture inside? Suddenly, without warning, tragedy strikes. The family clings to their faith to prevent them from starving as their crops die; with nothing they can do to prevent it.\n\nThe period is an appropriate choice given how humans treated each other centuries ago, and an ideal setting for a horror tale. Some conversations require a little more attention, as the characters speak in &apos;ye olde English&apos; which takes a little getting used to, but it adds another layer of mystery as the family is struck by more inexplicable hardships, causing them to become wary of each other, which in turn leaves them in a increasingly vulnerable state. I can&apos;t say I is scared, but I do know that I is gripping the armrests pretty hard for most of the film. Hell, they manage to make a scene where a man is hunting a rabbit seem tense and creepy! Additionally, this is not for inattentive viewers; I could see clock-watching all around me. The incredible camera-work almost reminds me of Paul Thomas Anderson in There Will Be Blood, with many long takes, often slowly panning or zooming in. There is also a focus on facial close-ups reminiscent of Bergman, all of which is a feast to watch on an IMAX screen. The score matches this camera-work almost to perfection, while there is often a lengthy silence between dialogue to contrast the tense music. It also must be mentioned that the child actors really shine, out-doing their older counterparts.\n\nThis really is my sort of horror film. No jump-scares, convincing acting and a focus on a dark, foreboding atmosphere rather than the grotesque and bloody. This is another of those films I would label as a psychological thriller, as the supernatural horrors are kept almost completely out of view as we witness the downfall of a family who are all affected, turning on each other as their faith is truly tested.\n\nThis film couldn&apos;t have catered to my interests more; I can&apos;t recommend it to everybody, but if you go in with no preconceived notions you&apos;ll be in for a tasty, if not nasty surprise. The suspense is almost unparalleled among recent films, and the &apos;horror&apos; genre conventions are cleverly subverted to deliver a film that is better than &apos;It Follows&apos; while being a completely different film. In addition to all this, there is much to take in thematically if you are so inclined\u0085 Hell, I&apos;d love to see this again to do just that.\n\nwww.epilepticmoondancer.net"

Not entirely, but I walked away happy regardless.\n\nFor those unaware it&apos;s Groundhog Day (1993) with murder as we see a girl repeatedly being killed off only to start to day anew. Personally I loved this idea and was curious with where they were going to go with it.\n\nThe traditional slasher tropes are all present, some great dark humor is in the script and the cast are all on point. Notable especially is our leading lady Jessica Rothe who was excellent though I spent half the movie baffled by just how much she looks like Melissa Benoist.\n\nI&apos;m not sure the finale was up to the same quality as the rest of the film and that is perhaps why it&apos;s receiving a 7 not an 8. Something about it just felt inferior and saw the movie go out with a bit of a fizzle.\n\nRegardless I can see why the film was so successful, congratulations to everyone involved because though I didn&apos;t find it as mind blowing as I&apos;d hoped I can&apos;t deny that this is a very inventive fun little film.\n\nThe Good:\n\nJessica Rothe\n\nCast are all great\n\nFantastic concept\n\nSome great ideas\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWeak soundtrack for a movie of this ilk\n\nFinale was underwhelming\n\nHearing the same dialogue repeatedly can get frustrating",

                "reviewBody": "Classic, wonderful sci-fi / horror feature, a none too faithful adaptation of the John W. Campbell, Jr. short story &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;. In this instance, the idea of the alien entity being a monstrosity that can imitate other life forms is jettisoned, in favour of making the creature basically like the Frankenstein monster. It&apos;s a super vegetable that requires blood for sustenance, and it makes life very tense for the scientists and military personnel at an isolated Arctic outpost when it&apos;s thawed from an icy imprisonment.\n\nWith an intrepid hero in the form of 1950s icon Kenneth Tobey on hand, it&apos;s a guarantee that &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot; is going to be a good time. It was a fairly odd choice of material for the producer Howard Hawks, who fills the story with overlapping dialogue and a sense of camaraderie among the various protagonists. Unlike the 1982 version, where the characters had the means to destroy the creature but first had to *identify* who the creature was, our cast here have to improvise their survival.\n\nWhile any genre fan such as this viewer, who&apos;d been brought up on the 1982 John Carpenter film, may be more inclined to favour that brand of horror, this is still very stylish fun. Hawks&apos;s editor Christian Nyby gets the directing credit, but it&apos;s generally believed that Hawks was pretty much in control of things. The score by Dimitri Tiomkin, utilizing the theremin, is suitably eerie. There are solid shocks, moments of suspense, and atmosphere along the way, as well as a lively finish.\n\nThis is a film very much of its time, with our military characters very much a dependable bunch of heroes, and the scientists (most of them) treated as highly suspect, especially the misguided Dr. Carrington, played delightfully by Robert Cornthwaite.\n\nA little too much time is devoted to the romantic subplot with Captain Hendry and his love interest (Margaret Sheridan), but the actors couldn&apos;t be more engaging. Tobey, Sheridan, and Cornthwaite are extremely well supported by a strong ensemble: Douglas Spencer as annoying newspaperman Scotty (who has the honour of uttering the memorable closing monologue), James Young, Dewey Martin, Robert Nichols, William Self, Eduard Franz, Nicholas Byron, John Dierkes, George Fenneman, Paul Frees, David McMahon, and Norbert Schiller. A young James Arness, in his pre-&apos;Gunsmoke&apos; days, has great presence as The Thing.\n\nThere are images here so striking that Carpenter was wise to pay homage to them in his film: the line of men encircling the buried UFO, and the sight of the burning creature crashing through the building into the snow.\n\nIt&apos;s definitely a different beast, in more ways than one, than what we would see 31 years later, but it&apos;s solid entertainment for its own very good reasons.\n\nEight out of 10.",

                "reviewBody": "First off I must say that I love this movie that was wonderfully directed by Frank Oz. Always have since the first time I saw it as a youngster. It is a remake of sorts to the 1960 Roger Corman film under the same title. But, this film is based on the play that was based on that film. This film is filled from beginning to end with great, super-catchy early 60s inspired songs that many of the main characters sing.\n\nThe plot is about a nerdy florist Seymour Krelborn (played to perfection by Rick Moranis) who seems to stumble across a new plant that he has growing in the basement of Mushnik&apos;s (Vincent Gardenia) where he also works and lives. He has called the plant Audrey II due to his affection for his coworker Audrey (great performance by Ellen Greene). Once he finds out though that it takes blood to feed his new plant he must soon find ways to feed the plant that has given Mushnik&apos;s a ton of business.\n\nI must say that apart from the great songs, wonderful puppetry of the Audrey II plant is that the acting to me is top notch. No one gives a below par performance from Steve Martin as the super abusive, drug addicted dentist named Orin Scrivello (don&apos;t forget the DDS) who loves to inflict pain on people to Bill Murray who plays Arthur Denton who loves pain and wants Orin to give him a long, slow root canal. The whole time Murray is on screen I am laughing. Martin though in this film must play the worst human being he has ever played that I remember anyways. Martin sings &quot;Dentist!&quot; which might be the funniest song in the film. Audrey II is voiced by Levi Stubbs who sang with The Four Tops and really I think they made the perfect choice as he can really sing, but also really bring out the bad attitude that Audrey II has.\n\nAlso starring John Candy, Jim Belushi, Tisha Campbell and Christopher Guest.\n\nSo if you think you might like The Muppets Meet 60s B-Movie with 60s styled music with a blend of horror and sci-fi give it a try.",

A bit confusing at first, but whenever something bad happens (like the father cutting his thumb on the champagne bottle) something good immediately takes its place (the kid switching on what was previously a dead light bulb). The house absorbs the good (the sacrificial new family&apos;s spirit and energy) while its inhabitants wither away, physically or mentally. Bette Davis&apos; Aunt Elizabeth ages suddenly (with frighteningly effective make-up), and Anthony James as the chauffeur who haunts Oliver Reed&apos;s head is a scary, freaky presence. Karen Black is even odder than usual: I&apos;m not certain whether her not-quite-there expression is what was intended for the role of Marion, but she does something very gutsy for an actress, making herself into a gargoyle (only in her final scene does she overdo it). Superior to the source novel by Robert Marasco, &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; (the title taken from a biblical reference) is a well-directed slice of the macabre. *** from ****",

Seeing a tomato chase Mason Dixon on a sidewalk before my very eyes was far too unbelievable, and I giggled out in thinking it was the most downright hilarious thing mankind has ever seen!  I hadn&apos;t even noticed that the film existed at all! That was until almost a decade later when I finally got to see it on local TV, and I began to realize that THIS FILM WAS FOR REAL!!! Possibly NO other motion picture in history has managed to make clever strangeness and ridicule like &quot;Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes&quot;! A film like this can be so BAD, that it&apos;s actually GOOD! However, I felt that this could have been another &quot;audience participation&quot; outing just like &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; because it can be seen millions of times over. With some occasional musical numbers and plenty of scenes to be addicted to, this would have had a humongous impact on millions of viewers to keep going to the movie theater over and over to see this fun picture. &quot;Killer Tomatoes&quot; plays like a lengthy national anthem, worthy of my time and money! Now, if only I can try to educate millions on how to enjoy watching low-budget movies without getting totally embarrassed! After all, any unknown movie worth $10,000 can still be worthy!"

                "reviewBody": "Canadian nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is employed by wealthy Paul Holland (Tom Conway) to take care of his catatonic wife Jessica in the West Indies. It is never said exactly where in the West Indies this is, but it is mentioned that there is a strong presence of voodoo on the island.\n\nBetsy is told by Jessica&apos;s doctor that Jessica has been this way since she had a bad case of a tropical fever, and the catatonia was the aftermath. Jessica can walk and follow simple commands, but she is mute and doesn&apos;t seem to comprehend what is going on around her.\n\nBetsy gets to know both her boss Paul, who is a joyless curmudgeon who proves to be secretly sensitive, as well as his brother Wesley, who is outwardly charming but dangerously embittered. But it&apos;s the permanently unavailable Paul whom she grows to love. When a voodoo-believing servant tells Betsy that voodoo has the power to cure Jessica, Betsy takes Jessica to the voodoo encampment to see if they can cause her to reclaim her sanity. Complications ensue.\n\nThe film is for sure atmospheric, like all of the entries from Val Lewton during this time period. That atmosphere includes lumbering women in billowing long white gowns, tall stone staircases, and high gray ceilings. A great sense of unease runs through the veins of this movie from start to finish.\n\nWhat did I not like? Character development is very abbreviated. And the locals who inhabit the island seem more like they are sporting the accent of the blacks of the American south than the West Indies. Plus the explanation of events is delivered in just a couple of sentences at the end and left me very unsatisfied - Show me, don&apos;t tell me! But then this was meant to be a 70-minute RKO quickie, not a horror classic, so it is remarkable that with such a small budget it has managed to have such staying power over the years. I&apos;d recommend it.",

                "reviewBody": "Review of &quot;The Rite&quot; DVD Rated PG-13 114 minutes By Leticia Velasquez Catholic Media Review\n\nMichael Kovak (Colin O&apos;Donoghue) has always been &quot;a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.&quot; (Isaiah 53:3) The only son of a Chicago funeral director, Itsvan Kovak (Rutger Haer) Michael lived literally down the hall from death his entire life. Unlike most young men who never experience death close hand, Michael is steeped in it, preparing bodies for burial with his father. As a young boy, Michael is coaxed by his father into helping prepare the corpse of his mother, by gently blowing on the red fingernail polish his father applies as he lovingly prepared her body, while whispering endearments into her ear. The image is forever seared into his memory, tainting his adulthood with a lack of faith and a sense of detachment. \n\nWhen time came to make a decision about his profession in life, Michael knew well that his options were limited, as he told a friend, &quot;in my family; you either become an undertaker or a priest&quot;. Michael chose the priesthood, not out of sense of mission, but as a way out of his bleak existence and a means to pay for college. After he is ordained as a deacon, Michael&apos;s guilt over deceiving his superior about his intentions impels him to write Fr Matthew (Toby Jones) about his decision to leave the seminary. He admits he has no faith and feels he has no vocation to the priesthood. \n\nBut fate intervenes before Fr Matthew can act. The two men are involved in a car accident where a young woman is fatally wounded and Fr Matthew looks on stunned silence as Michael blesses the victim reluctantly yet tenderly as she dies. He is impressed by this and convinces Michael to delay leaving the seminary until after he has taken a two month course in Rome. A course in exorcism; &quot;you&apos;re an undertaker, so you&apos;re not squeamish&quot; he adds with a gleam in his eye.\n\nNot at all squeamish, Michael plays the role of devil&apos;s advocate in his exorcism class in Rome, challenging his instructor over whether the possessed are suffering from psychosis, and is nonplussed over a sudden power outage when the demon Baal is mentioned. In order to help Michael overcome his doubts about the existence of Satan, his professor, Fr Xavier (Ciaran Hinds) sends him to observe veteran exorcist Fr Lucas Trevant (Anthony Hopkins). Michael is joined in his doubts by Italian journalist Angeline (Alice Braga) who wants him to share his experiences at Fr Lucas side for the purposes of an article. These two young cynics are about to engage in a life and death struggle which will evoke deep- seated fears and upend their world view\n\nAn eccentric Welshman, Fr Lucas lives a lonely existence in an obscure corner of Rome, occupying an ancient villa whose courtyard is overrun by cats. Fr Lucas takes Michael&apos;s cynicism in stride, and advises Michael not to engage in conversation with the demon who possesses the pregnant teen who has come with her sister for her regular exorcism session. Michael is so captivated by her predicament that he finds himself drawn into a life and death struggle with the devil whose very existence he denies.\n\nAlthough the movie trailer plays like a high-tech adaptation of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, to which exorcism films will inevitably be compared, there is more spiritual and emotional depth to director Mikael Hafstrom&apos;s work than Blatty&apos;s. &quot;The Rite&quot; more closely resembles the cinematic subtlety and theological accuracy of &quot;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&quot;, according to Fr. Gary Thomas, the priest from the book on which the film is based. Michael is a sympathetic character and the film&apos;s dramatic exposition of the tragic origins of his faith crisis help the audience sympathize with him as he confronts demons both within and without his tortured soul. Even eccentric Father Lucas, played compellingly by Hopkins is more vivid than the ghostly older priest in &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, yet the pairing of priests to defeat Satan is a familiar theme. Fr Lucas even makes a sarcastic reference to &quot;The Exorcist&quot; telling Michael, &quot;You&apos;ll see no spinning heads and pea soup here!&quot; What will enliven Catholic viewers is the authenticity of the phenomena of the exorcisms and the splendor of the priesthood when contrasted against the darkness of pure evil. Special effects enhance but do not overpower this compelling thriller and magnificent architecture of Rome augments the timelessness of the story. \n\nFor the many fans of the book by AP journalist Matt Baglio, on which the film is loosely based, screenwriter Michael Petroni has respected the basic story while raising the emotional stakes to great dramatic effect when combined with excellent cinematography and the masterful presence of Anthony Hopkins. Priests who watched the film in the theater with me had a positive reaction but pointed the following theological errors; as a deacon, Michael could not give absolution as he appears to do in the case of the dying woman, and that an inexperienced priest with emotional wounds and of questionable faith would never be chosen to become an exorcist. Too many weaknesses for Satan to exploit, they explained. The manifestations of possession (vomiting nails and frogs, unearthly voices, superhuman strength and knowledge of inner weaknesses) are absolutely accurate, according to Fr Gary Thomas, the real priest from Baglio&apos;s book, who had a less dramatic change of heart about the existence of Satan. When I asked him in an interview whether he believed that the devil was a being he responded, &quot;I believed when I met him&quot;. \n\nFor older teens and up for frightening and macabre scenes, appropriate but vivid sexual innuendo (verbal references to incest and rape) and foul language. This film is best seen with parental supervision.",

But it reminded me of Rosemary&apos;s Baby and that&apos;s saying a lot. As the story unfolds you see how truly horrifying this persons (Toni Collette) life has been.. the performances are spot on. This movie really ramps up in the last twenty minutes.. it&apos;s not fir everyone but it creeped me out and I watch a lot of horror.  Give it a shot .. it&apos;s well worth it.",

It is confusing much of the time but when it is all over you realize it is a fable of sorts for the lead character, Dani, to come to some resolution from the loss of her family and coming to terms with her dud of a boyfriend.\n\nLook up the entire lyrics of &apos;Hotel California&apos; by The Eagles, with this movie in mind you can find many parallels.\n\nI already was a Florence Pugh fan from her roles in Lady MacBeth (2016) and Fighting With My Family (2019). Here she is Dani who tragically loses her sister and parents, in grief accompanies her boyfriend and three other guys to Sweden in late June to witness, and ultimately participate in, a ritualistic Pagan festival. But it also goes deeper, to the core of the group&apos;s beliefs. By the end Dani achieves resolution, the other four are not so fortunate.\n\nThis is a really strange movie once they get to Sweden, there is very explicit and gory violence, there is a big non-erotic sex scene with a number of nude characters. Everything is designed to shock the senses of the viewer. I would not like to see movies like this on a regular basis but as a one-off experience I found it a totally worthwhile 2 1/2 hours."

                "reviewBody": "Made in 1919, &quot;The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari&quot; was literally years ahead of its time and remains a triumphant accomplishment in the genre of German Expressionism. Remembered mainly for its stunning sets, which featured crooked buildings and twisted landscapes, &quot;Cabinet&quot; also boasts one of the first attempts at a twist ending, something quite new and shocking for its time.\n\nTold mainly from the point of view of Francis, a young man who lives in the small village of Holstenwall, Germany, &quot;Cabinet&quot; tells the tale of murder and madness which seems to accompany the arrival of a carnival. Francis and his best friend Alan go to the carnival and are presented with the sideshow attraction Cesare the Somnambulist, a gaunt and hideous young man who spends his life sleeping in a coffin-like cabinet and seems able to predict the future when awake. Cesare (played by a young Conrad Veidt, who later went on to play the evil Nazi general in Casablanca) informs Alan that he will soon die, and indeed, Alan is found murdered the next morning. Suspicion turns to the eerie somnambulist and his strange keeper, a man called Caligari. As Francis desperately tries to solve the mystery and find his friends killer, it seems that the beautiful young Jane, beloved by both Alan and Francis, has been targeted as the next victim.\n\nThis is a genuinely creepy film which delves deep into the mysteries of the abnormal mind...an uncomfortable journey to say the least. Everyone is suspect and, in the end, we must ask ourselves: &quot;who is really the mad one here?&quot; \n\nSubtle and ingenious, we see the world the way an insane person might see it; warped and confused, a nightmarish terrain where nothing makes sense and balance is not to be found. \n\nThe impact of this film is still being felt and seen today, and for good reason. It is a shocking, disturbing masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",
